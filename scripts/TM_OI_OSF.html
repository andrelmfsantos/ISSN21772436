/* This file is a compatability layer.  It allows the usage of flexible box 
model layouts accross multiple browsers, including older browsers.  The newest,
universal implementation of the flexible box model is used when available (see
`Modern browsers` comments below).  Browsers that are known to implement this 
new spec completely include:

    Firefox 28.0+
    Chrome 29.0+
    Internet Explorer 11+ 
    Opera 17.0+

Browsers not listed, including Safari, are supported via the styling under the

Dominant Topics (top 3): [&#39;T2&#39;, &#39;T4&#39;, &#39;T1&#39;]
Paper Summary:
Open practices have been at the forefront of research, business and political agendas for some time. Traditionally, research has focused on analysing critical factors for the deployment of Open Source (OS) Software and has highlighted the roles of &#34;Collective Intelligence&#34; and &#34;participation in voluntary communities&#34; in facilitating OS development. Nevertheless, there is little literature examining the role these Open Innovation practices may play in influencing the private-collective model of i

Paper Summary:
A conceptual model has been developed to present comprehensively the processes and linkages of invention and Open Innovation for those knowledge workers who want to transform idea of a new product or service into a reality. The progression of idea conceptualization, realization and marketing is further divided into two phases; first is invention and second is Open Innovation. These phases are integrated into a complex framework representing a comprehensive flowchart which provides a snapshot of

Paper Summary:
A critical success factor in the practice of Open Innovation is the timely identification of opportunities for out-licensing a firm&#39;s technologies outside its core business. This can be particularly challenging for small- and medium-sized enterprise (SMEs), because of their focussed business portfolio, specialized knowledge basis, and limited financial resources that can be devoted to innovation activities. The paper illustrates a quick and easy-to-use methodology for the identification of viabl

Paper Summary:
A growing number of chain actors, together with difficulties in single-handedly meeting the heterogeneous needs of customers, end-users and legislators, is driving the food industry to open up to external sources of knowledge in search of successful new products and technologies. Empirical evidence of food companies engaging in Open Innovation remains, however, scarce, as do detailed analyses of related business strategies. We review extant literature on Open Innovation practices in the food ind

Paper Summary:
A reverse supply chain, as a post-consumption activity, aims at extracting value from products at end of their life cycle (Mafakher and Nasiri, Journal of Cleaner Production 59: 185-196, 2013). As well, company&#39;s awareness is attracting increasing attention toward sustainable business practices. Open-innovation is a typical example of coordinative activity that a manufacturer should share a profits generated through reverse supply chain with retailer. The aim of this paper provide insights towar

Paper Summary:
Each individual member of an organization must recognize and lead innovation, which can be affected by human resource development (HRD) investments and organizational changes. In this study, we aimed to verify how HRD investment at the individual level relates to employee perceptions of organizational innovativeness and to examine how the intensity of organizational change, a situational factor at the organizational level, affects the relationship between HRD investment and employee perceptions

Paper Summary:
Geographic research on firm-level innovation is generally premised on the idea of Open Innovation, suggesting that innovation occurs more readily in urban settings or clusters, which generate local buzz and allow access to external actors. However, a growing body of evidence demonstrates that firms also introduce first-to-market innovations in remote locations. In this exploratory paper, building upon work by Philip McCann, we outline a conceptual framework that connects innovators (differentiat

Paper Summary:
Academia–enterprise collaboration is understood as a determinant that improves innovation and competitiveness. The mechanisms by which this collaboration occurs have awakened increasing interest among academics, as well as in the business sector. This research aims to identify how Open Innovation communities can mediate the academia-enterprise relationship, as well as the factors that are more affected by this mediation. Based on the literature, the article addresses the definition of Open Innov

Dominant Topics (top 3): [&#39;T2&#39;, &#39;T6&#39;, &#39;T1&#39;]
Paper Summary:
Academics and practitioners have demonstrated that Open Innovation is critical to superior performance; firms thereby connect their in-house R&amp;D functions with external partners to enhance their innovation activities. This study extends the Open Innovation theory and the knowledge-based view to explain how a firm&#39;s external knowledge resource acquisition influences its innovation deployment as well as its performance. Specifically, we argue that technology scouting plays an important role as an
