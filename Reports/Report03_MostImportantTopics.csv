0,"Open practices have been at the forefront of research, business and political agendas for some time. Traditionally, research has focused on analysing critical factors for the deployment of Open Source (OS) Software and has highlighted the roles of ""Collective Intelligence"" and ""participation in voluntary communities"" in facilitating OS development. Nevertheless, there is little literature examining the role these Open Innovation practices may play in influencing the private-collective model of innovation and its application in economies-in-crisis to create public-good innovations. To address this gap, this paper uses the case of Greece. Data were gathered from interviews conducted with public policy makers and private sector top executives. The findings underline the importance of using OS as software to deal with cost reduction during debt crisis; but more importantly reveal a shift from OS to utilising the aforementioned Open Innovation practices to support the creation of public-good innovations through the private-collective model of innovation, and the difficulties faced in encouraging this initiative due to insufficient national innovation policy, and different philosophies, structures, and cultures followed by the organisations. The study calls for changes in the national policy supported by the private-collective model to leverage innovation. ",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.026,-0.04,-0.023,-0.028,0.013,-0.026
1,"A conceptual model has been developed to present comprehensively the processes and linkages of invention and Open Innovation for those knowledge workers who want to transform idea of a new product or service into a reality. The progression of idea conceptualization, realization and marketing is further divided into two phases; first is invention and second is Open Innovation. These phases are integrated into a complex framework representing a comprehensive flowchart which provides a snapshot of gradual transition of invention processes into Open Innovation processes. The conceptual model rests on existing literature that methodologically connects access to finance, funding constraints, cognitive and social dimensions, skills, mental model, conceptual knowledge and knowledge production capacity of the scientists (i.e., knowledge worker), scope and pioneering of the invention, technological infrastructure, collaboration with private firms and universities and utilization of digital technologies. The invention, as well as Open Innovation activities, are discussed with respect to World Intellectual Property Organization and Global Innovation Index country rankings and the number of patents filed and granted to the world including Pakistan. The framework is a rigorous but rewarding process for a knowledge worker who designs and develops a new product, process, procedure, mechanism and methodology to serve humanity and the marketplace.

2,"A critical success factor in the practice of Open Innovation is the timely identification of opportunities for out-licensing a firm's technologies outside its core business. This can be particularly challenging for small- and medium-sized enterprise (SMEs), because of their focussed business portfolio, specialized knowledge basis, and limited financial resources that can be devoted to innovation activities. The paper illustrates a quick and easy-to-use methodology for the identification of viable opportunities for out-licensing a firm's technologies outside its core business. The method uses established TRIZ instruments in combination with non-financial weighting and ranking techniques and portfolio management tools. It has been developed by the authors in collaboration with an Italian SME working in the packaging industry. ",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.021,0.016,-0.01,-0.006,0.019,0.02
3,"A growing number of chain actors, together with difficulties in single-handedly meeting the heterogeneous needs of customers, end-users and legislators, is driving the food industry to open up to external sources of knowledge in search of successful new products and technologies. Empirical evidence of food companies engaging in Open Innovation remains, however, scarce, as do detailed analyses of related business strategies. We review extant literature on Open Innovation practices in the food industry and analyze their effects on the sector's innovation capabilities and market outcomes. Finally, we draw implications for food innovation and highlight areas where research is needed. ",Life Sciences,0.018,-0.007,-0.015,0.0,0.0,0.028
4,"A reverse supply chain, as a post-consumption activity, aims at extracting value from products at end of their life cycle (Mafakher and Nasiri, Journal of Cleaner Production 59: 185-196, 2013). As well, company's awareness is attracting increasing attention toward sustainable business practices. Open-innovation is a typical example of coordinative activity that a manufacturer should share a profits generated through reverse supply chain with retailer. The aim of this paper provide insights toward Open Innovation practice in sharing profits between two strategic partners, manufacturer and retailer to maximize an individual profits as well as total profits concurrently in reverse supply chain. For analyzing effects of Open Innovation strategies, we modeled reverse supply chain environments using system dynamics approach and compared the gap of profits between non-coordinative (decentralized) and coordinative activity. Three cooperative contracts in terms of how to share the cost and profit between two parties are proposed in this paper. Each contract was analyzed according to the following three contract processes. The first stage is that manufacturer proposes contracts to retailer. The second is that retailer evaluates proposed contracts and choices the best contract which can lead to maximize its expected profit. Finally retailer and manufacturer adjust parameters of the best contract for achieving mutual goal of supply chain. Through the experimental results, we discuss best coordinative strategy between manufacturer and retailer in order to maximize a profit in reverse SC.

5,"Each individual member of an organization must recognize and lead innovation, which can be affected by human resource development (HRD) investments and organizational changes. In this study, we aimed to verify how HRD investment at the individual level relates to employee perceptions of organizational innovativeness and to examine how the intensity of organizational change, a situational factor at the organizational level, affects the relationship between HRD investment and employee perceptions of organizational innovativeness through multilevel analysis using hierarchical linear models. We performed an analysis based on the responses from5184 workers and 125 companies where corporate-level and personal-level data were matched in a Human Capital Corporate Panel (HCCP) survey. HRDinvestment by employees was shown to increase the perception of organizational innovativeness. The results demonstrated that the intensity of organizational change moderated the relationship between HRD investment and the perception of organizational innovativeness. However, the stronger the organizational change intensity, the weaker the positive effect of HRD investment on the perception of organizational innovativeness. Finally, we presented theoretical and practical implications and further research tasks related to the HRD of corporations and Open Innovation.

6,"Geographic research on firm-level innovation is generally premised on the idea of Open Innovation, suggesting that innovation occurs more readily in urban settings or clusters, which generate local buzz and allow access to external actors. However, a growing body of evidence demonstrates that firms also introduce first-to-market innovations in remote locations. In this exploratory paper, building upon work by Philip McCann, we outline a conceptual framework that connects innovators (differentiated by information source and frequency of interaction with interlocutors) and location (distance from a metropolitan area): slow innovators, relying on non-market-sourced information and infrequent contacts, will be overrepresented in isolated locations. Fast innovators, relying on market-sourced information and frequent interactions, will locate closer to cities. Our results confirm this. Our interpretation of these results – slow innovators are more reliant on technological information which loses value more slowly than faster decaying market-oriented information – requires further investigation.

7,"Academia–enterprise collaboration is understood as a determinant that improves innovation and competitiveness. The mechanisms by which this collaboration occurs have awakened increasing interest among academics, as well as in the business sector. This research aims to identify how Open Innovation communities can mediate the academia-enterprise relationship, as well as the factors that are more affected by this mediation. Based on the literature, the article addresses the definition of Open Innovation communities (OICs), university–enterprise cooperation, knowledge transfer (KT), as well as an understanding of OICs as a mechanism for academia–enterprise transfer. An analysis of twelve OICs, conformed by professors, students, graduates, and experts from a Colombian higher education institution is performed. For the data analysis, a factor analysis involving structural equation modeling is carried out. Our results highlight the most important characteristics to take into account in the study of knowledge transfer when OICs are involved, and they also indicate the level of connection between these factors.

8,"Academics and practitioners have demonstrated that Open Innovation is critical to superior performance; firms thereby connect their in-house R&D functions with external partners to enhance their innovation activities. This study extends the Open Innovation theory and the knowledge-based view to explain how a firm's external knowledge resource acquisition influences its innovation deployment as well as its performance. Specifically, we argue that technology scouting plays an important role as an antecedent to collaboration with horizontal and vertical technology acquisitions. Furthermore, the horizontal technology collaboration and vertical technology collaboration play mediators in determining firm performance returns from executing such acquisitions. Based on a large-scale survey of high-tech firms, the study finds that the ability to build well-developed external connection channels increases the efficacy of inbound Open Innovation in achieving superior performance.

9,"According to the WHO Global Digital Health Strategy 2020-2024, we should advocate people-centred health systems, promote global collaboration and strengthen the governance of global digital health practices. All this requires a new Open Innovation approach, which means that stakeholders from regional administrations, hospitals, companies and intermediate organisations openly work together towards commonly identified global and regional digital health goals. Although both practice and theory have proven that the Open Innovation approach is beneficial for companies and end-users, there is still a need for increased understanding of what leads to the success of digital health related to regional competitiveness through the implementation of policies based on people-centred Open Innovation. This study is a longitudinal case study in which Open Innovation ecosystem partners (including challengers (healthcare organisation representatives), solvers (companies), funders (policy organisations) and supporters (intermediate organisations) were monitored and analysed in three countries. The focus of the paper is to explore a digital health Open Innovation ecosystem over the years. The results show that the created demand-driven Open Innovation model can be used to strengthen the governance of digital health, and to improve communication density and knowledge transfer between the ecosystem actors. The new model is a useful way to make funding structures clearer and to improve the people centricity of digital health solutions. The findings help policy-makers to use Open Innovation as a policy instrument supporting hospital and company managers to increase understanding of the opportunities of demand-driven Open Innovation.

10,"Accounts of open source software (OSS) development projects frequently stress their democratic, sometimes even anarchic nature, in contrast to for-profit organisations. Given this observation, our research evaluates qualitative data from Wikipedia, a free online encyclopaedia whose development mechanism allegedly resembles that of OSS projects. Our research offers contributions to the field of Open Innovation research with three major findings. First, we shed light on Wikipedia as a phenomenon that has received scant attention from management scholars to date. Second, we show that OSS-related motivational mechanisms partially apply to Wikipedia participants. Third, our exploration of Wikipedia also reveals that its organisational mechanisms are often perceived as bureaucratic by contributors. This finding was unexpected since this type of problem is often associated with for-profit organisations. Such a situation risks attenuating the motivation of contributors and sheds a critical light on the nature of Wikipedia as a role model for Open Innovation processes.

11,"Achange in U.S. patent law in the early 1980s increased the value of patents, particularly for firms in the electronics and semiconductors industry, yet many of the industry's leading firms did not embrace patenting after the change. We show through an in-depth study of International Business Machines (IBM), the world's largest patentee, that the company's practices during much of the 1980s discouraged patenting. IBM adopted pro-patent management practices in 1989 after the installation of a new research and development head and in the face of faltering financial performance. IBM's increased patenting and licensing activities improved its financial bottom lines but curtailed its industry-wide knowledge spillovers. These causes and consequences of pro-patent practices are visible in several other large U.S. corporations. Thus, in the context of the ""patent explosion"" of the 1980s, we show that intraorganizational forces such as inertia, financial pressures, and new leadership shaped established firms' uptake of pro-patent management practices and their success. Our findings also suggest that pro-patent practices associated with ""Open Innovation"" may stem the free flow of knowledge across organizational boundaries.

12,"Activity-based costing system, commonly known as the ABC system, emerged as a costing method capable of overcoming the limitations of traditional costing systems in face of economic and technological developments, namely, the arbitrary and imprecise allocation of indirect costs from distortions in the imputation criteria. In the current context, the development of an adequate costing system is of extreme importance in organisations because they feel the need to properly manage the resources at their disposal and control their costs to achieve efficient and effective management. Thus, this study aims to analyse international publications on the activity-based costing system in recent years, identifying trends in evolution and future research opportunities. Based on bibliometric techniques, the outputs obtained in theWeb of Science (n = 752) and Scopus (n = 1107) databases were analysed in bibliometrix R package to make a systematic mapping and review of the literature. After removing duplicates, we obtained a final output of 1419 articles. The analysis of these publications points to a growing trend in the publication of articles on ABC, highlighting publications in partnership and their dispersion in magazines from different areas. The bibliometric analysis carried out results on the authors’ global research performance over time, and we highlighted the pioneering publications every five years and analysed the general evolution. When analysing based on publication authors over time, we highlighted the main research themes and countries where studies had been carried out. On the other hand, we also highlighted the collaborative network between institutions, authors, and countries over time. ",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.032,-0.04,-0.02,-0.021,-0.006,-0.022
13,"Adequate management of intellectual property (IP) is critical to sustaining competitive advantage and managing outbound Open Innovation, which describes the inside-out flows of knowledge and technology. This article presents an IP strategic framework comprising the following strategies: a ‘defensive’ strategy, aimed at avoiding knowledge spillovers and building barriers to competition; a ‘collaborative’ strategy, aimed at collaborating with other organizations and entering new markets; and an ‘impromptu’ strategy, which describes firms protecting their IP without a clear purpose. We investigate the relationships of such IP strategies with outbound OI and innovation performance in 158 Italian firms. Most of them declared an impromptu IP strategy. We found that not having any IP protection strategy can be a barrier to outbound OI and that firms with a defensive IP strategy embraced outbound OI more than those declaring a collaborative IP strategy. Finally, firms with collaborative IP strategies outperformed those with defensive strategies. ",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.038,0.044,0.042,0.018,0.039,0.054
14,"Advancements in information technology (IT) have made organizational boundaries so porous, thereby resulting in a trend toward leveraging external knowledge for innovation. However, firms experience significant obstacles in drawing external knowledge. This study aims to disentangle the role of IT-enabled absorptive capacity in new product development performance. The research model was tested with survey data of Open Innovation projects from 152 firms. Our findings indicate that IT-enabled absorptive capability improves Open Innovation project performance in terms of new product innovativeness and product speed to market, but we do not detect a significant direct influence of openness on performance. Our findings also show that the interaction of IT-enabled absorptive capacity and ideation openness significantly amplifies new product innovativeness while the interaction of IT-enabled absorptive capacity and implementation openness accelerates the product speed to market. This study theoretically contributes by building an IT-enabled absorptive capacity theory in the Open Innovation context and uncovering the effects of two dimensions of openness. In practice, it offers managers strategies to successfully conduct Open Innovation projects in deploying effective ITs and leveraging various types of openness during the two phases.

15,"Advances in information technology (IT) have enabled firms to increasingly rely on Open Innovation. Although researchers and practitioners are interested in this phenomenon, there is a lack of theoretically driven research on how IT impacts organizational Open Innovation performance. Drawing on the strategic IT alignment perspective and related literature, we proposed a model to explain the performance of organizational Open Innovation; i.e., the alignment between IT strategies and the openness of Open Innovation strategies results in different outcomes for Open Innovation. Through the analysis of data from 225 firms in China, we found that the alignment between IT flexibility and breadth enhances innovation radicalness and innovation volume, whereas the alignment between IT integration and depth positively affects innovation volume only. Innovation volume and radicalness were found to enhance organizational performance in terms of sales growth. Our study contributes to the literature on Open Innovation and strategic alignment. Its findings also have important managerial implications for practitioners. ",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.03,0.023,0.006,-0.022,-0.031,0.017
16,"Although Open Innovation has become increasingly established in the management literature, comprehensive theoretical explanations of what drives firms to be open are sparse. Taking the perspective of the behavioral theory of the firm, we conceive of Open Innovation as a form of nonlocal search, arguing that firms will turn to Open Innovation when substantially under- or over-performing relative to their aspirations. We further enquire how this relationship is moderated by firm-specific innovation-related resources: human capital, research and development investment, and patents. Employing a representative survey of UK firms, we find some evidence of moderation, allowing us to present explanations of search through Open Innovation and contribute to the behavioral theory of the firm itself.

17,"Although public support for innovation is one of the main contemporary topics in innovation management and even economic and industrial development, there are no recent studies that have consolidated and analyzed the publications on the topic, especially from the perspective of Open Innovation. Therefore, the objective of this article is to contribute to the field by assessing what types of public practices for innovation comprise the term ""public support for innovation'' and its relationship with OI. To achieve these objectives, we conducted a systematic review and qualitative analysis of 121 articles. Our results reveal that (i) the use of the term ""public support for innovation'' is emerging in innovation management and innovation policies; (ii) there are differences in research approaches that focus on ""innovation policy'' and ""public support for innovation''; and (iii) the OI is used more than management theories to analyze public support for innovation. Furthermore, our results indicate that public support for innovation can be analyzed from four dimensions: (i) financial support for R&D activities; (ii) development through innovation; (iii) support for sectorial programs; and (iv) university–industry–government collaboration (triple helix).

Since SMEs often have a dominant impact on national economies, their innovative potential should not be neglected. While SMEs in developed countries have learned how to innovate, SMEs in developing countries face a range of obstacles that hinder them from innovating as much as they could. This paper suggests that in these cases a government agency, using innovation hubs, could help SMEs to connect, communicate and collaborate with independent inventors and other parties to jumpstart innovation practices.

The relatively new emerging paradigms in various sciences, such as geometry (fractals), physics (quantum), and database systems (distributed ledger—blockchain), seem to potentially contribute to a greater shift in the framework of the finance industry, bringing also some concerns (cyber-threats). Consistent and extensive investigation of the reasonable potential impact of these new models (and their underlying technologies) is performed, and then tested through a SWOT analysis, as the main objective of this research. Threats and opportunities are always intrinsically driven by the introduction of technological advancements (revolutions). This research confirms that information availability and the increasing interconnection of crosswise applications of each discovery to the different fields of science is determining the rapid succession of revolutions identified by evident large shifts in economic paradigms. The growing computing capacity and the development of increasingly powerful predictive software are leading to a competitive, extremely dynamic, and challenging system.

The purpose of this paper is to more clearly define the concept of co-creation and to articulate how it differs from and relates to the concept of Open Innovation. Scholars are divided as to whether co-creation is a subsidiary concept of Open Innovation, a surrogate concept that is essentially indistinguishable from Open Innovation, or a separate concept that developed independently but was subsequently intermingled and interfused with Open Innovation. This paper addresses this scholarly confusion by conducting a systematic two-stage review of the innovation management literature, commencing with of a ‘broad brush’ bibliometric analysis, focused on the origins and evolution of co-creation and Open Innovation, followed by a ‘deep dive’ literature review in which the two concepts were rigorously compared.

26,"As the creative economy has developed, the university has been given an important role of nurturing creative talents that companies desire to have. The most important objective in creative education is to provide a support system and a good environment for fostering creativity. This will help students in obtaining results and profits through experimenting as well as gaining experience in each step of the process in performing innovation by developing their ideas through utilizing self-directed information and knowledge. There are various creative economy-related businesses being conducted in Korea, which have been supported by the government since 2008, the supporting environment has been constructed to utilize the internal and external systems of universities. However, there are a number of cases where supporting projects that are possible to utilize are overlapping each other or support for projects is not available, as these sorts of supporting systems are designed according to the purpose and drawing performances for each business. For this, creating a ""student customized innovation model"" has been attempted by linking internal and external support for universities with a process of steps from design thinking to commercialization. The education model in universities should be established by balancing the roles and needs of enterprises, universities, and governments. An Open Innovation based system should be built for students who are being nurtured the university. The research method for this is as follows: First, the research aim was determined by considering the relationship between creative economy and the concept of Open Innovation. Second, a new model was developed by analyzing and doing case investigation of university convergence education programs that nurtured creativity. Third, this proposed model (CHEESE program (CHEESE Program stands for Creativity Human Emotional Experience Solution Evaluation)) was customized and designed based on the linkages between the creative education programs and open-innovation. Then, the outcomes from the project's three years test run were analyzed and organized. The development of the model was intended for design-engineering students based on integrating design-engineering thinking and activities in the process of innovation.

However, empirical and quantitative approaches to monitoring the patterns of Open Innovation are less conducted because of the difficulty in data collection and the lack of effective methods. Also, it is difficult to identify the patterns of Open Innovation when there are many cases of Open Innovation in a wide range of technology areas. In this respect, this paper aims to quantitatively monitor the patterns of Open Innovation using the patent-based brokerage analysis in the case of mobile communications technology. Using patent citation information, the knowledge flow between technology fields and firms is identified, especially for structuring the Open Innovation network of 5G technology. Then, the patent-based brokerage analysis based on the Open Innovation network is conducted to extract brokerage patents that present the patterns of Open Innovation: inbound and outbound innovation. Furthermore, the brokerage firms are explored to recommend the partnerships in the Open Innovation network.

30,"As with all new ideas, the concept of Open Innovation requires extensive empirical investigation, testing and development. This paper analyzes Procter and Gamble's 'Connect and Develop' strategy as a case study of the major organizational and technological changes associated with Open Innovation. It argues that although some of the organizational changes accompanying Open Innovation are beginning to be described in the literature, more analysis is warranted into the ways technological changes have facilitated Open Innovation strategies, particularly related to new product development. Information and communications technologies enable the exchange of distributed sources of information in the Open Innovation process.

Against this background, this research focuses on a comparative case study of two non-profit project networks that attempt to operate in line with the OSS phenomenon: Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia, and the development of an automobile, Open Source car. We show that many parallels to the OSS arena can be drawn in both cases. However, this analysis must be performed cautiously, as several factors limit the applicability of OSS principles to non-software-related arenas.

33,"Background/Objective: The Chinese government is actively developing the rural economy and promoting the poverty alleviation campaign. The economic development of the traditional agricultural areas is essential to people’s basic livelihood and social stability. The tourism industry has been proven to be an effective approach to promote the regional economy. It has become a hot issue as to how to develop the tourism industry in rural areas. Methods/Statistical Analysis: Based on a corresponding index system, a coupling coordination model was established to explore the coupling and coordination development of the agricultural industry and the tourism industry in Henan province, a traditional agricultural area in China. Findings: The result revealed that although the coupling degree between the agricultural and the tourism industry from the year of 2009 to 2018 is relatively stable, the coordination degree shows a continuous rising trend from 0.278 to 0.921. This indicated that the agricultural industry and the tourism industry in Henan province continues to interact with and influence each other, and the comprehensive development level and the coordination degree of the two industries have been constantly improved. Implications: From the result, it can be seen that the integration development of the agricultural industry and the tourism industry could be a new path to develop the economy of rural areas. From the perspective of sustainable development, suggestions are proposed to optimize the agricultural industrial structure, extend tourism industry chain and construct support policy to develop a sustainable mode of the agricultural industry and the tourism industry.

34,"Background: Despite recent successes at controlling malaria, progress has stalled with an estimated 219 million cases and 435,000 deaths in 2017 alone. Combined with emerging resistance to front line antimalarial therapies in Southeast Asia, there is an urgent need for new treatment options and novel approaches to halt the spread of malaria. Plasmodium, the parasite responsible for malaria propagates through mosquito transmission. This imposes an acute bottleneck on the parasite population and transmission-blocking interventions exploiting this vulnerability are recognized as vital for malaria elimination. Methods: 13,533 small molecules with known activity against Plasmodium falciparum asexual parasites were screened for additional transmission-blocking activity in an ex vivo Plasmodium berghei ookinete development assay. Active molecules were then counterscreened in dose response against HepG2 cells to determine their activity/cytotoxicity window and selected non-toxic representative molecules were fully profiled in a range of transmission and mosquito infection assays. Furthermore, the entire dataset was compared to other published screens of the same molecules against P. falciparum gametocytes and female gametogenesis. Results: 437 molecules inhibited P. berghei ookinete formation with an IC50 &lt; 10 μM. of which 273 showed &gt;10-fold parasite selectivity compared to activity against HepG2 cells. Active molecules grouped into 49 chemical clusters of three or more molecules, with 25 doublets and 94 singletons. Six molecules representing six major chemical scaffolds confirmed their transmission-blocking activity against P. falciparum male and female gametocytes and inhibited P. berghei oocyst formation in the standard membrane feeding assay at 1 μM. When screening data in the P. berghei development ookinete assay was compared to published screens of the same library in assays against P. falciparum gametocytes and female gametogenesis, it was established that each assay identified distinct, but partially overlapping subsets of transmission-blocking molecules. However, selected molecules unique to each assay show transmission-blocking activity in mosquito transmission assays. Conclusion: The P. berghei ookinete development assay is an excellent high throughput assay for efficiently identifying antimalarial molecules targeting early mosquito stage parasite development. Currently no high throughput transmission-blocking assay is capable of identifying all transmission-blocking molecules. ",Life Sciences,0.016,-0.013,-0.006,-0.021,-0.002,-0.003
35,"Background: Food engineering is at a crossroads. Inertia, combined with diminishing research funding, declining new academic positions, combined with disruptive and emerging competitive adjacent domains have a heavy toll on the field and its attractiveness for talented faculty members and students. The proliferation and flourishing of many bio-disciplines highlight the acute need for food engineering profession to revise its vision, strategy and missions and to reinvigorate and expand its horizon. Open Innovation is a concept developed for commercial applications for gaining competitive advantages. Open Innovation is based on utilizing both external and internal ideas and open channels for accessing and employing knowledge and solutions. Open Innovation main philosophy should be adopted to integrate, assimilate and synergize food engineering core fundamental principles and to build on the accelerating developments in emerging knowledge, science and technology. Scope and approach: To fully benefit from the vast future emerging opportunities, food engineering is faced with a plethora of demanding challenges (e.g., new curricula, innovation ecosystem, partnerships, creativity, multidisciplinary, entrepreneurship, sustainability, food and nutrition security, population growth, health and wellness, nutrition, bioavailability). 'Enginomics' (engineering + omics) - a new term coined to express some of the major food engineering future challenges that holistically combines food processing and human internal digestion. It calls for studying human internal transport phenomena, utilization of new techniques (e.g., micro-processing, virtualization) for modelling and simulation, emerging topics (e.g., bioavailability, signaling, satiety, personalized nutrigenomics, targeting, pro- and prebiotics, nanotechnology, biotechnology), as well as traditional food and product engineering. Key findings and conclusions: The food engineering domain should rise to future mounting challenges and opportunities by redefining its vision and strategy recapturing its significant roles, and stopping the loss of its graduates in the competitions with other fields. Several paradigm shifts are recommended including reinventing its curricula in pursuing of excellence with a start-up-university (innoversity) mentality, new mindset for promoting Open Innovation, implementing virtualization, embracing enginomics and social responsibility. As a part of enginomics and health and wellness, the development of low cost, fast and accurate bioavailability tests is required. Open Innovation provides food engineers with the unique prospects for spearheading the four-helix innovation ecosystem. Both basic and applied science and utilizing of the most advanced and up-to-date technologies and scientific breakthroughs are paramount. ",Life Sciences,0.031,-0.019,-0.045,0.005,0.025,0.046
36,"Background: In the marketing literatures, ""articulation of demand"" is quoted as an important competency of market-driving firms. In this paper, therefore, I will demonstrate how the concept of ""demand articulation"" was effective in formulating corporate policies for technology and market development, and also in government policies for accelerating the commercialization process of emerging technologies. Methods: In order to comprehend empirically what really means ""demand articulation"", i.e., how ""market-driving"" is different from ""market-driven,"" we conducted a quantitative analysis of market growth paths in three different kinds of product categories. Results: We came to the arguments of ""business model"" creation, which will bring the concept of ""demand articulation"" into a reality under an emerging business environment of Open Innovation. Conclusions: In order for the concept of ""Open Innovation"" to be effective, the accumulation and advanced utilization of big-data is an absolute necessity. In other words, the combination of business model creation, accompanied by the accumulation of big data and its advanced utilization, can make the arguments of market-driving more plausible, and make the accuracy of demand articulation more enhanced. As far as business model itself is concerned, the experimentation and simulation of alternative business models becomes possible with the sheer existence of big-data.

38,"Based on the patent data collected from smartphone industry over the period 2000–2017, we utilize two-stage least squares to investigate the bidirectional relationship between network inertia and inbound Open Innovation practices. Furthermore, our research is of great benefit to better understanding of the interplay of network reach and network centrality on network inertia and inbound Open Innovation, and the moderating effects of network centrality on the reciprocal relationship between network inertia and inbound Open Innovation practice. The empirical results confirm that there is a bidirectional relationship between network inertia and inbound Open Innovation, and network centrality shows the moderating effect on the above relationship. Moreover, network centrality moderates the positive effects of network reach on network inertia and inbound Open Innovation. These findings suggest that network centrality and network reach are important factors of the firms’ network inertia and inbound Open Innovation. The results of the models in this paper suggest that firms with higher network inertia in the innovation networks are less likely to search for sources outside their boundary. In summary, we fill the research gap in exploring the bidirectional relationship between network inertia and inbound Open Innovation. ",Physical Sciences,0.041,0.021,-0.003,-0.023,-0.031,-0.06
39,"Bee venom is a sub-product of the beekeeping activity, and has a wide field of applications in several pivotal markets. Nevertheless, its collection is not an activity disseminated among Portuguese beekeepers, as its production is marginal. There are limited empirical studies on the production and the technical aspects involved in this type of activity. Our study, therefore, contributes to narrowing this knowledge gap, by analyzing and comparing the productivity and profitability of two bee venom collection techniques. The first involves equipment available on the market, and the second involves a new device developed from the aim of the present work. Concerning market knowledge, a questionnaire was given to a sample of beekeepers, to understand and characterize the market's needs and the level of information about bee venom. Because of the growing market interest in this product, a new collector is proposed, based on a set of intensive frame collectors strategically placed inside the beehives. The improvements obtained were increased production, either in terms of quantity or quality, obtaining a positive profitability. To evaluate the productivity of the proposed equipment, a comparison was performed, in an apiary, between existing state-of-the-art equipment and the proposed intensive collector. In a second stage, the profitability of the new proposed equipment was analyzed, using a comparative method between incomes and costs associated with both solutions. The results obtained showed that the new intensive collector enables a profitable collection of bee venom in Portugal, despite its higher initial investment.

40,"Being a grand challenge of global scale, the COVID-19 pandemic requires collective and collaborative efforts from a variety of actors to enable the expected scientific advancement and technological progress. To achieve such an Open Innovation approach, several initiatives have been launched in order to leverage potential distributed knowledge sources that go beyond those available to any single organization. A particular tool that has gained some momentum during COVID-19 times is hackathons, which have been used to unleash the innovation potential of individuals who voluntarily came together, for a relatively short period of time, with the aim to solve specific problems. In this paper, we describe and analyze the case of the hackathon EUvsVirus, led by the European Innovation Council. EUvs Virus was a 3-day online hackathon to connect civil society, innovators, partners, and investors across Europe and beyond in order to develop innovative solutions to coronavirus-related challenges. We have identified four dimensions to explore hackathons as a crowdsourcing tool for practicing effective Open Innovation in the face of COVID-19: broad scope, participatory architecture, online setting, and community creation. We discuss how these four elements can play a strategic role in the face of grand challenges, which require, as in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, both urgent action and long-term thinking. Our case analysis also suggests the need to look beyond the 'usual suspects', through knowledge recombination with atypical resources (e.g., retired experts, graduate students, and the general public). On this basis, we call for a broader perspective on Open Innovation, to be extended beyond openness across organizational boundaries, and to explore the role of openness at societal level.",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.026,-0.027,-0.032,0.02,0.007,-0.008

Specifically, a firm practicing inbound activities to strengthen radical innovation is more likely to benefit from knowledge sharing capabilities than from knowledge acquisition capabilities. In contrast, a firm practicing outbound activities is more likely to enhance radical innovation performance through knowledge acquisition capabilities than through knowledge sharing capabilities.

Contrary to earlier research, however, this influence is negative when Open Innovation activities are involved. This is particularly relevant in the context of Chinese innovation, in which the same innovation networks that promote efficient production may hinder the development of innovations.

In this regard, the Open Innovation model seems to provide efficient support for the involvement of private firms in public collaborations, by ensuring that there is efficiency and affordability in the delivery of new and 'smart' city services. This inquiry aims to fill a gap in the main field of research: only a very few studies have tried to analyse the challenges encountered, and the strategies followed, by firms developing Open Innovation strategies with public partners in Smart City Projects (SCPs). In trying to fill this gap, exploratory and qualitative analysis was performed on the decision-making processes of multinational companies participating in SCPs.

With reference to and in line with these cases, interesting predictions emerge relating to public-private collaborations and the creation of different forms of explorative and exploitative project alliances in cities. In particular, companies that develop alliances with public partners consider the Open Innovation model to be a testbed for future technologies and the development of products and services, by supporting positive knowledge spill-oven that reduce the technological gap between the private and the public sector and-at the same time-stimulating the development of a smart city ecosystem when firms are looking for the cross-fertilization of ideas.

58,"Cooperation with other organizations increases the innovation performance of organization, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as they encounter liabilities of smallness (e.g., limited financial resources, and manpower). In the medical devices sector, collaboration with external partners for NPD becomes increasingly important due to the complexity of the products and the development process. About 80% of companies in this sector are SMEs. These companies operate in a highly regulated sector, which affects the organization of the external network required for the new product development (NPD) process. SMEs are practicing extensively Open Innovation activities, but in practice face a number of barriers in trying to apply Open Innovation. This paper examines multiple network characteristics simultaneously in relation to innovation performance and thereby aligns with and builds further on configuration theory. Configuration theory posits that for each set of network characteristics, there exists an ideal set of organizational characteristics that yields superior performance. In this research, the systems approach to fit is used. Fit is high to the extent that an organization is similar to an ideal profile along multiple dimensions. This ideal profile represents the network profile that the 15% highest performing companies use. It is argued that the smaller the distance between the ideal profile and the network profile that is used, the higher the performance. The objective of this research is (1) to examine the relation between the ideal profile and innovation performance and (2) to examine which organization of the network profile is related to high innovation performance. Quantitative survey data (n?=?60, response rate 61.9%) form the core of this research. The quantitative results are clarified and have been triangulated with qualitative interview data (n?=?50). Our findings suggest the presence of an ideal NPD network profile (in terms of goal complementarity, resource complementarity, fairness trust, reliability trust, and network position strength): the more a company's NPD network profile differs from this ideal profile, the lower the innovation performance. In addition, the results of our study indicate that the NPD network profiles of successful and less successful SMEs in the medical devices sector significantly differ in terms of goal complementarity, while this is less the case for trust and resource complementarity labeled distinctive by previous research. Finally, results show that a relatively closed, focused, and consistent business-like NPD networking approach, which is characterized by result orientation and professionalism, is related to high innovation performance. It is recommended that SMEs in the medical devices sector aiming to distinguish themselves from competitors in terms of innovation performance focus on goal complementarity while adopting such a business-like attitude toward their NPD network partners.",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.069,-0.03,-0.017,-0.075,-0.132,-0.002

The main goal for the use of an accelerator program by an established corporation is to open up the innovation process and actively profit from the innovative capacity of new ventures. However, until now there has been little empirical investigation of the characteristics of this particular model of “Open Innovation”. This paper outlines the key features of corporate accelerator programs and presents empirical data on their characteristics. The existing literature generally reflects positive results from this form of innovation but displays a lack of empirically and theoretically grounded research of how accelerator programs work. Using a standard, holistic taxonomy for programs, covering such components as strategy, resources, roles and structure, we analyzed and assessed data from stakeholders engaged in this approach to innovation in order to understand the expectations and reasoning behind these programs.

The 2030 civil servant will require a wide set of soft and hard skills that are not common among the today’s public administrators but are attributable to young people. The following questions then arise: Will the demand for qualified civil servants be reduced because of optimization of public administration processes? How significant is the demand for young people by the civil service? Is civil service attractive as a vector of career development among young people? The research objective is to provide quantity estimates of the Russian civil service’s hiring potential and to match that potential with young people’s attitude towards public administration employment. Using the panel regression, regions that can expand the civil service staff were identified and the necessary preconditions and policies to take use of this potential were indicated.

61,"Currently, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) play a leading role in most of the world’s economies. For this reason, they seek technological competitiveness and improvement of their innovation activities. In this context, Open Innovation and eco-innovation are important elements to achieve these goals. With this background, the purpose of this paper is to analyze the relationship between technological capability, Open Innovation, and eco-innovation in corporate performance, testing a structural equation model using SmartPLS in a sample of 684 small and medium-sized companies in Mexico. The main results show that technological capability significantly influences Open Innovation and eco-innovation practices, not directly in corporate performance, but through Open Innovation or eco-innovation. Our results also confirm the positive effects that eco-innovation and Open Innovation have on SMEs’ corporate performance. These results have important implications in the literature on dynamic capabilities that have not been previously tested. For companies and decision-makers, it shows why these practices in small and medium-sized companies should be encouraged. ",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.028,-0.006,0.02,-0.027,-0.076,0.004

We want to answer the following research question in this study: ""How can a government enact policies to conquer the growth limits imposed on the economy by inequality or the control of big businesses?"" First, we conducted a literature review to establish the concept of building a causal loop model of basic income with Open Innovation dynamics. Second, we built a causal loop model which includes basic income and all factors of Open Innovation dynamics. Third, we proved our causal loop model through a meta-analysis of global cases of basic income. Our research indicates that reflective basic income with permissionless Open Innovation, capital fluidity, a sharing economy, and a platform tax can motivate Open Innovation dynamics and arrive at a method by which an entrepreneurial state can conquer the growth limits of capitalism.

Thus, the beliefs and norms that exist in the social capital of the Balinese Hindu concept can filter the information obtained from various information in business, which will ultimately be utilized by women entrepreneurs to create various innovations to meet the market demand. However, opportunities for women entrepreneurs are very limited to capital due to lack of guarantees to get capital, and a lack of entrepreneurship skills in the technological era, market access, bureaucracy, and legalization. Further, managerial skills, access to information technology, as well as the perspective that the men must be superior in Balinese culture and customs, make business for women entrepreneurs limited.

Eminent scholars have called for large-scale studies that systematically investigate the OI paradigm. Drawing on the knowledge-based view of the firm, new product development, and NPD capabilities literature streams, we conceptualize a framework in which OI practices are disentangled according to the stage of the new product development process in which they occur (development stage or commercialization stage). We identify two major types of OI practices: development-centric OI (which occurs in the development stage) and commercialization-centric OI (which occurs in the commercialization stage). Specific types of NPD capabilities—R&D, market information management, and launch—are expected to both influence the extent to which each OI practice is implemented and moderate the effect of each OI practice on product portfolio innovativeness and firm performance. The empirical analysis combines primary data from a survey of 239 firms with secondary data on innovation and financial outcomes. Our results support our hypotheses and indicate a need to differentiate among the different kinds of OI practices while elaborating on the complex role played by NPD capabilities in influencing OI practices.

OI can be realized in numerous of ways, including Open Source Software (OSS) involvement. Outcomes from OI are not restricted to product innovation but also include process innovation, e.g. improved SE practices and methods. This study explores the involvement of a software organization (Sony Mobile) in OSS communities from an OI perspective and what SE practices (requirements engineering and testing) have been adapted in relation to OI. It also highlights the innovative outcomes resulting from OI. An exploratory embedded case study investigates how Sony Mobile use and contribute to Jenkins and Gerrit; the two central OSS tools in their continuous integration tool chain. Quantitative analysis was performed on change log data from source code repositories in order to identify the top contributors and triangulated with the results from five semi-structured interviews to explore the nature of the commits. The findings of the case study include five major themes: i) The process of opening up towards the tool communities correlates in time with a general adoption of OSS in the organization. ii) Assets not seen as competitive advantage nor a source of revenue are made open to OSS communities, and gradually, the organization turns more open. iii) The requirements engineering process towards the community is informal and based on engagement. iv) The need for systematic and automated testing is still in its infancy, but the needs are identified. v) The innovation outcomes included free features and maintenance, and were believed to increase speed and quality in development. Adopting OI was a result of a paradigm shift of moving from Windows to Linux.

67,"Despite pervasiveness of the market forces and supplementary role of the state and in some cases, even civil society organisations, there are unmet social needs which remain unaddressed by the existing institutions. With industrial growth becoming jobless, the need for new models of social innovation is being felt all around the world to provide jobs to the youth, skills for the new economy and entrepreneurial opportunities for transforming resources and skills. The persistence of some of these unmet needs (also referred as wicked problems sometimes) or unaddressed problems for a long time shows that the existing institutional arrangements are inadequate for the purpose. Innovations are imperative. A socio-ecological system that recognizes and rewards innovation can withstand many external shocks, provided it is agile and innovates quickly to remain responsive to emergent challenges (Anderies, Janssen, & Ostrom. Ecology and society, 9(1)2004). Whether corporations will follow an Open Innovation approach to blend grassroots ideas and innovations with their expertise in a reciprocal, responsible and respectful manner (Gupta et al., Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity 2: 16, 2016) is still an open question. The design of appropriatemanufacturing and frugal supply chain will then become closely linked with other features of Open Innovation ecosystem. The debate on the role of social innovation in multi-stakeholder context in European focused on how these innovations fostered trust among different actors and influenced policy (Defourny and Nyssens. Social Enterprise Journal 4: 202-228, 2008). In this paper, we describe the market and social forces which influence the emergence of social innovations through various processes. We then look into the evolutionary pathways for social innovations (Mulgan, Innovations 1: 145-162, 2006), to avoid inertia and spur initiatives to bridge the social gap in an inclusive manner through mobilization of youth in particular. The ecosystem for social Open Innovations provides scope for connecting corporations and communities (Herrera, 2015; Gibson-Graham and Roelvink, Social innovation for community economies: how, 2013). Following the theory of reciprocal and responsible Open Innovation systems (Gupta et al., Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity 2: 16, 2016), we explore the way barriers are overcome on the way to reach the base of economic pyramid [BOEP] customer. Technological adaptability and institutional or market adaptability are explored to understand how communities get empowered to deal with corporations through an Open Innovation platform. The corporations need to be empowered to understand the decision heuristics followed by grassroots and community frugal innovators (Gupta, Innovations 1: 49-66, 2006). Just as communities need to be empowered to negotiate fair and just exchange relationship with corporations (Honey Bee Network, 1990-2017).

Using survey data collected from 331 firms, this article empirically assesses the theoretical assertion that the NIH and NSH syndromes have negative impacts on the adoption of inbound and outbound Open Innovation. Furthermore, it investigates how their effects can be reduced through competence-building programs based on the training of employees.

84,"Extant research demonstrates that e-Government initiatives often fall short of achieving innovative forms of government and governance due to a techno-centric focus that limits such initiatives to minor improvements in service delivery. While it is evident that innovation is central to modernising and transforming governmental organisations, and that the co-creation of services by public authorities and community groups is an essential component of realising the benefits of investment in information and communication technology, there is little research focusing on the nature of innovation in transforming governmental organisations and services. Addressing this gap in the literature, this paper explores how Open Innovation strategies can transform public administration by examining how a network of municipalities in Sweden transforms value creation and service delivery by collaborating with each other and with external parties to accelerate the creation and exploitation of innovation. Using a case study with embedded units of analysis, four emerging typologies of governmental transformation based on Open Innovation are identified. The paper illustrates how these Open Innovation typologies (i) transform the organisation of the municipalities and (ii) help them deliver high quality co-created services to citizens. By examining the strategic and operational aspects that facilitate such activities, the analysis reveals the impact of Open Innovation on the business models of public authorities. The paper concludes that Open Innovation practices represent a more radical manifestation of transformational government than previously envisaged; signalling not only fundamental change in the nature of value creation and service delivery by public authorities, but potentially in the nature of their organisation.

Using the exploration-exploitation dichotomy as our theoretical framework, we develop hypotheses on how impediments to innovation influence the breadth and depth of OI. We then test these hypotheses by using an exceptionally large and detailed data set to estimate population-averaged panel models.

88,"Few studies on Open Innovation address OI practices in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and how their use of OI and the resulting benefits differ from those of large enterprises. The lack of resources in SMEs to engage in looking outward is said to be a barrier to OI, but at the same time this shortage is cited as a motive for looking beyond organisational boundaries for technological knowledge. We investigate how OI dimensions impact the innovative performance of SMEs in comparison to large companies. The key finding is that the effects of OI practices in SMEs often differ from those in large firms.

Turnover from new products in SMEs is driven by intellectual property protection mechanisms, while large firms in this case benefit more from their search strategies.

89,"Findings – The analysis allows us to propose a theoretical framework and to highlight how different structural capital shape heterogeneous processes by which incubatees build their RC. The authors find that important differences in RC formation are present both at an exchange of knowledge level within the incubator, and across incubator boundaries.Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate the strategies business incubators (BI) adopt in respect to the creation of incubatee intellectual capital, and it focuses in particular on links between BI structural capital and the creation of incubatee relational capital (RC). By crossing IC literature with the Open Innovation paradigm the authors consider the incubator as an innovation intermediary and the authors investigate how different incubator strategies of knowledge exchange take place within and across incubator boundaries. The main issues the authors seek to explore regard the mechanisms by which incubators shape the exchange of knowledge within and across their boundaries and the rationale underlying such an approach.Design/methodology/approach – The analysis is based on a multiple case study research involving five Italian incubators. Primary and secondary data were gathered through interviews with each incubator managing director and with relevant actors.Research limitations/implications – The main limitations of this study regard the generalizability of results. This is mostly an exploratory work and further research based on quantitative rather than qualitative analysis, would provide stronger evidence in order to validate the results with respect to the population of incubators and consequently lead to more precise policy implications.Originality/value – The analysis points to the importance of recognizing different BI approaches regarding the mechanisms by which incubatees develop their RC, and allows us to gain a knowledge-based conceptualization of incubators. This definition moves beyond the more diffuse classification based on public vs private and sectoral specificities, and introduces some new insights for further research.

90,"Firms are increasingly leveraging social media tools to access knowledge from external actors, particularly customers and other users, to facilitate the innovation process and firm performance. Yet empirical research investigating the impact of external knowledge sourced via social media tools is scant; empirical studies that do exist are mixed, leading to calls for research into the conditions under which knowledge flows via social media from external actors contribute to innovation and firm performance. Using a large-scale survey of firms in Tasmania, Australia, this study examines how external knowledge flows from market-based actors sourced by social media influence innovation and business performance, and the extent to which modern human resource management (HRM)practices moderate this relationship. We find that while knowledge flows from market-based actors are positively related to innovativeness, the relationship between external knowledge flows via social media and innovativeness depends on the importance a firm places on modern HRM practices: a significant positive relationship exists between knowledge sourced via social media and innovativeness when firms attach high importance to modern HRM practices. In contrast, there is no significant relationship in firms in which modern HRM practices are of low importance. The study also shows that social media serves as a mediator for the effect of external knowledge flows on firm innovativeness when firms attach high importance to modern HRM practices. Furthermore, while the results demonstrate that innovativeness and firm performance are positively related, innovativeness does not translate into improved firm performance in firms that attach low importance to modern HRM practices. Taken together, the findings underscore the importance of modern HRM practices to enable knowledge inflows via social media to influence innovativeness, and innovativeness to translate into productivity benefits.

91,"Firms in many industries are seeking to incorporate ideas from outside parties to complement their own internal resources and capabilities. Suppliers, distributors, end users, scientists, firms in unrelated industries and even competitors can be important sources of information and ideas. Furthermore, with the computing capabilities available today, firms can scan online communities for sources of ideas and even harness the ideas generated by a select few key users with insights into emerging mainstream customer needs. All of this additional input helps firms compete profitably in an increasingly difficult environment. New trends include Open Innovation, crowdsourcing, user toolkits, mass customization and lead-user analysis. While there is emerging academic research on all of these topics, their usefulness in fashion marketing and merchandising remains relatively unexplored. This is potentially a great research opportunity, as fashion designers can obtain key ideas that boost competitiveness by working more closely with customers, suppliers, retailers and other parties. This article presents the state of the art in each of these trends, and concludes with a discussion of the implications for fashion marketing and merchandising academic research and practice.

92,"Firms in Open Innovation ecosystems expand organizational resources and allow for collaborations across organizations, which can promote the flow, aggregation, and integration of resources within business network ecosystems. Yet, particular gaps in the literature limit our understanding of how Open Innovation ecosystems contribute to firm product innovation. Therefore, this study explores the causal recipes of how Open Innovation ecosystem modes promote product innovation by using both grounded theory and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). First, by taking four innovative firms as case studies and applying grounded theory, we identify six specific Open Innovation ecosystem modes: “firm-university-institute cooperation,” “interfirm cooperation,” “firm-intermediary cooperation,” “firm-user cooperation,” “asset divestiture,” and “technology transfer.” Then, based on the data of 226 innovative firms, we employ fsQCA to explore the causal configurations of the Open Innovation ecosystem modes that consistently improve product innovation. The findings reveal that three particular combinations can explain the high level of product innovation: (1) interfirm cooperation, firm-intermediary cooperation, and technology transfer combined with asset divestiture; (2) interfirm cooperation, firm-intermediary cooperation, and technology transfer combined with firm-university-institute cooperation; and (3) interfirm cooperation, firm-intermediary cooperation, and firm-university-institute cooperation combined with firm-user cooperation. Overall, this work contributes to the theoretical literature on Open Innovation ecosystems and provides practical information for firms looking to achieve value creation.

93,"Firms increasingly acquire technological knowledge from external sources to improve their innovation performance. This strategic approach is known as inbound Open Innovation. The existing empirical evidence regarding the impact of inbound Open Innovation on performance, however, is ambiguous. The equivocal results are due to moderating factors that influence a firm's ability to acquire technological knowledge from external sources and to transform it into innovation outputs. This paper focuses on a relevant yet overlooked category of moderating factors: organization of research and development (R&D). It explores two organizational mechanisms: one informal and external-oriented (involvement of external consultants in R&D activities) and one formalized and internal-oriented (existence of a dedicated R&D unit), in the acquisition of technological knowledge through R&D outsourcing, a particular contractual form for inbound Open Innovation. Drawing on a capabilities perspective and using a longitudinal dataset of 841 Spanish manufacturing firms observed over the period 1999-2007, this paper provides a fine-grained analysis of the moderating effects of the two organizational mechanisms. The involvement of external consultants in R&D activities strengthens the impact of inbound Open Innovation on innovation performance by increasing marginal benefits of acquiring external technological knowledge through R&D outsourcing. Moreover, it reduces the level of inbound Open Innovation to which the highest innovation performance corresponds. Instead, the existence of a dedicated R&D unit makes the firm less sensitive to changes in the level of inbound Open Innovation, by reducing marginal benefits of acquiring external technological knowledge through R&D outsourcing, and increases the level of inbound Open Innovation to which the highest innovation performance corresponds. The results regarding the role of informal and formalized R&D organizational mechanisms contribute to research on Open Innovation and absorptive capacity, and also inform managers as to what organizational mechanism is recommended to acquire external technological knowledge, depending on the objectives that the firm pursues.

94,"Firms increasingly adopt an Open Innovation model in which they rely on technology alliances to complement and supplement their internal innovation efforts. Although previous studies provide in-depth insight into the impact of technology alliances on the innovation performance, they remain relatively silent on how technology alliances eventually influence the financial performance of the firm. The purpose of this paper is to develop and test a conceptual framework that disentangles both the value-enhancing and cost-increasing effects of technology alliances on financial performance. The model was tested with a sample of 305 Belgian manufacturing firms. Combining data from the Belgian Community Information Survey (CIS IV) database and the BELFIRST database, structural equation analyses were conducted on the connection among technology alliance portfolio diversity, product innovation performance, and financial performance. This study's data provide empirical confirmation for the 0061ssumption of existing research that technology alliance portfolio diversity has an indirect positive impact on financial performance via increased product innovation performance. However, a direct cost-increasing effect of technology alliance portfolio diversity on financial performance is observed. Moreover, the structural equation analyses suggest that, in the short-term, the direct cost-increasing effect of technology alliance portfolio diversity exceeds the indirect value-generating effect of technology alliances. These findings contribute to the current research on Open Innovation in two important ways. First, these results support the Open Innovation model by illuminating the interconnectedness between internal and external innovation strategies. In particular, technology alliance portfolio diversity has a positive impact on internal innovation efforts, which increases product innovation performance. Second, the findings complement the focus of existing Open Innovation research on the value-generating properties of technology alliances, directing attention to the cost-increasing effects of such collaborative strategies. On a managerial level, these findings suggest that, when making technology alliance decisions, managers not only should consider the potential benefits of such collaborative strategies but also should take into account the additional costs of intensifying the technology alliance portfolio.

95,"Firms may open up their innovation processes on two dimensions. While inbound Open Innovation refers to the acquisition of external technology in open exploration processes, outbound Open Innovation describes the outward transfer of technology in open exploitation processes. Prior Open Innovation research has focused on the inbound dimension, whereas the outbound dimension has been relatively neglected. Therefore, this article addresses the relationship between outbound open R&D strategies and firm performance. We use data from 136 industrial firms to test four hypotheses on the moderating effects of environmental factors in the relationship between Open Innovation strategies and firm performance. The results show that the degree of technological turbulence, the transaction rate in technology markets, and the competitive intensity in technology markets strengthen the positive effects of outbound Open Innovation on firm performance. By contrast, the degree of patent protection does not facilitate successful Open Innovation. The results are crucially important to managers because they show under what environmental conditions Open Innovation strategies enhance performance.

96,"Firms tend to transfer more knowledge in technology joint ventures compared to contractual technology agreements. Using insights from new institutional economics, this chapter explores to what extent the alliance governance association with interfirm knowledge transfer is sensitive to an evolving industry norm of collaboration connected to the logic of Open Innovation. The chapter examines 1,888 dyad-year observations on firms engaged in technology alliances in the U.S. information technology industry during 1980-1999. Using fixed effects linear models, it analyzes longitudinal changes in the alliance governance association with interfirm knowledge transfer, and how such changes vary in magnitude across bilateral versus multipartner alliances, and across computers, telecommunications equipment, software, and microelectronics subsectors. Increases in industry-level alliance activity during 1980-1999 improved the knowledge transfer performance of contractual technology agreements relative to more hierarchical equity joint ventures. This effect was concentrated in bilateral rather than multipartner alliances, and in the software and microelectronics rather than computers and telecommunications equipment subsectors. Therefore, an evolving industry norm of collaboration may sometimes make more arms-length governance of a technology alliance a credible substitute for equity ownership, which can reduce the costs of interfirm R&D. Overall, the chapter shows that the performance of material practices that constitute innovation ecosystems, such as interfirm technology alliances, may differ over time subject to prevailing institutional norms of Open Innovation.

97,"Firms that engage in distant search activities seek to leverage on external knowledge to innovate. The firms' ability to acquire new knowledge depends on strong search practices and the corresponding absorptive capacity where the latter predefine firms' ability to span out of its core competences area, to follow the Open Innovation processes. Absorptive capacity is often seen as a precondition for the Open Innovation success. This research focuses on the cases of Open Innovation when the absorptive capacity is absent internally and is taken in charge by an Open Innovation intermediary that is capable to develop the potential absorptive capacity for the firm. Based on an exploratory case study of an intermediary platform that proposes novelty driven search practices – ideXlab, our results demonstrate how intermediary can accelerate the absorptive capacity value recognition function and therefore, potentially facilitate further diffusion of knowledge.

At the same time, there has been a realization that engaging with Open Innovation can improve competitiveness. Our study aims to address two research questions: (a) How does engaging with Open Innovation support an organization's process innovation? and (b) How does the motivation to achieve legitimacy affect the relationship between engaging with Open Innovation and process innovation? We use arguments from the resource-based view to explain how Open Innovation influences an organization's likelihood of introducing new processes. We then use arguments from institutional theory to explain how the motivation to achieve legitimacy moderates this relationship. We test our conceptual model using data from the European Community Innovation Survey administered by the U.K. government. Our findings and theoretical development support the notion that engagement with Open Innovation will increase the likelihood of introducing new processes and that the motivation to achieve legitimacy will affect this relationship. However, this moderating effect will be different depending on how engagement takes place. It will be positive on co-operation with external parties, and negative on the use of information. Therefore, when organizations co-operate with external parties and are motivated to achieve legitimacy, the likelihood of introducing a new process will increase. However, the effect is opposite in the case of use of external information. These findings contribute to the understanding of the relationship between open and process innovation.

In addition, this practice makes it possible to examine how KM, in particular, the knowledge mapping, can be used to establish the flow of the internal and external information in order to increase the efficiency of creativity and invention.

118,"In an increasingly connected and networked world, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) recognizes the value of the public as a strategic partner in addressing some of our most pressing challenges. The agency is working to more effectively harness the expertise, ingenuity, and creativity of individual members of the public by enabling, accelerating, and scaling the use of Open Innovation approaches including prizes, challenges, and crowdsourcing. As NASA's use of Open Innovation tools to solve a variety of types of problems and advance of number of outcomes continues to grow, challenge design is also becoming more sophisticated as our expertise and capacity (personnel, platforms, and partners) grows and develops. NASA has recently pivoted from talking about the benefits of challenge-driven approaches, to the outcomes these types of activities yield. Challenge design should be informed by desired outcomes that align with NASA's mission. This paper provides several case studies of NASA Open Innovation activities and maps the outcomes of those activities to a successful set of outcomes that challenges can help drive alongside traditional tools such as contracts, grants and partnerships.

119,"In an innovation contest, a firm (the seeker) facing an innovation-related problem (e.g., a technical R&D problem) posts this problem to a population of independent agents (the solvers) and then provides an award to the agent that generated the best solution. In this paper, we analyze the interaction between a seeker and a set of solvers. Prior research in economics suggests that having many solvers work on an innovation problem will lead to a lower equilibrium effort for each solver, which is undesirable from the perspective of the seeker. In contrast, we establish that the seeker can benefit from a larger solver population because he obtains a more diverse set of solutions, which mitigates and sometimes outweighs the effect of the solvers' underinvestment in effort. We demonstrate that the inefficiency of the innovation contest resulting from the solvers' underinvestment can further be reduced by changing the award structure from a fixed-price award to a performance-contingent award. Finally, we compare the quality of the solutions and seeker profits with the case of an internal innovation process. This allows us to predict which types of products and which cost structures will be the most likely to benefit from the contest approach to innovation.

120,"In an Open Innovation relationship, the party that owns a key asset enjoys bargaining power that discourages the investments of the other party in the collaboration. We show that these incentives can be restored by conferring on the weak party the power to take decisions during the research process - e.g., a pharmaceutical firm with manufacturing and commercialization assets offers the direction of a joint research project to a biotech partner. However, on many occasions, the strong party still captures more value from the collaboration by retaining the power to take decisions during research even if it produces less innovation value and fewer aggregate profits. We conclude that the potential of Open Innovation is underexploited. In particular, owners may not release enough power to take decisions on the use of their assets.

Despite the popularity and success of these Open Innovation communities, relatively little is known about the factors that determine the implementation of the user-generated ideas. Based on research on individual creativity, we propose a conceptual model integrating users' previous experience, idea presentation characteristics and feedback valence to explain the likelihood of idea implementation. We validate our research model with a panel data analysis of 43 550 ideas submitted by 16 360 users in the MIUI new product development community hosted by Xiaomi, a large electronics manufacturing company in China. We find an inverted U-shaped relationship between users' past successful experience and idea implementation. Furthermore, the length of ideas is positively associated with the likelihood of idea implementation. There is also an inverted U-shaped relationship between supporting evidence and idea implementation. Finally, we demonstrate the negative effect of positive feedback and the positive effect of negative feedback on idea implementation. These findings offer rich insights to understand the phenomenon of Open Innovation better. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

An esthetics program has the effect of improving depression or low self-esteem to increase psychological and physical satisfaction, which is a good way to raise the happiness index of the elderly. However, there is a lack of esthetics education or esthetics programs in Korea to train estheticians to serve elderly people. This study confirmed the possibility of Open Innovation through esthetics education to increase the happiness index of the elderly. As a research method, a self-administered questionnaire was used to survey 572 estheticians and analyzed statistically. In this study, Korean estheticians were very positive about the need for the development of professional care programs for the elderly, and it was found that they are willing to care for the elderly.

123,"In light of the fact that firms increasingly use information technology (IT) for Open Innovation initiatives, this paper explores how IT investment influences their external search from multiple perspectives: breadth, and depth along vertical, horizontal and societal dimensions. The basic premise is that IT investment has inverted U-shaped relationships with external search breadth and depth. On the one hand, IT investment enhances firms' ability to acquire more information from external knowledge sources. On the other hand, however, IT investment can bring abundant information from external knowledge sources to firms, making it increasingly difficult to widely and deeply use the information from available sources. Beyond a certain threshold, excessive IT investment is likely to cause information overload, forcing firms with limited attention to narrow down and go less deeply into their external knowledge sources. By using a large-scale panel data set from German firms, we find empirical evidence corroborating our theory. ",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.039,0.074,-0.021,0.049,0.014,0.013
124,"In light of the recent economic crisis, many industrial firms attempt to capture additional value from their technologies by means of Open Innovation strategies. Besides acquiring external technology, many firms therefore increasingly try to license their own technology to other firms either exclusively or in addition to its application in their own products. This article shows that technology licensing offers important strategic benefits beyond generating licensing revenues, which underscore the need for an integrated management of technology licensing activities. Therefore, this article extends the concept of job-related markets that was recently developed in the managerial literature. A 'job' is the fundamental problem that a customer needs to resolve in a particular situation. Managers may transfer this job-related understanding to technology licensing activities because the right 'job' for a technology may be outside a firm's boundaries, and it may help firms to identify additional licensing opportunities. On this basis, the article presents the concept of an integrated technology exploitation roadmap, which allows firms to use the job-related markets to integrate technology licensing in their strategic planning processes. An example of a machinery firm shows how this roadmap may contribute to strengthening a firm's licensing business. ",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.052,0.112,-0.025,-0.054,0.101,0.125

127,"In Open Innovation, firms increasingly rely on online consumer votes to evaluate ideas for new products and services. Votes can represent cost-effective external information about idea quality that can inform and facilitate a firm's task of evaluating and screening of ideas at the early stages of the innovation process. Challenging this perception, we proposed that consumer votes provided in Open Innovation contests can be socially biased by reciprocal voting. On the basis of theories related to cooperation and social influence, we argued that both gregarious consumers (those who solicit social ties) and consumers who initiate direct reciprocity (those who vote for others) signal a willingness to cooperate that stimulates reciprocal voting from peers. We empirically investigated consumer voting behavior using a unique dataset with information obtained from actual Open Innovation contests in which consumers could submit their own ideas and see and vote for the ideas of others. We found that both gregariousness and the initiation of direct reciprocity positively influence votes received. Such cooperation pays off for consumers because firms indeed use votes to inform internal idea evaluations. We also found, however, that the votes an idea receives during an innovation contest cannot significantly explain its later revealed quality. Reciprocity may be an effective form of cooperation among consumers, but it has potentially negative implications for firms' evaluations. Our results also indicated that beyond reciprocity, consumers and firms value different types of ideas, which further differentiates their evaluations. Thus, firms should not only be aware of social biases in votes but also account for the diverging idea preferences of customers. ",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.039,0.061,-0.027,-0.02,0.027,-0.072

Hence, it is necessary to study the dynamic mechanism for obtaining a good decision. This paper first studies the evolution of individual interaction based on game theory and then studies the dynamic characteristics of large-scale interaction. According to the results of simulation, it is concluded that the opinions are convergent under various communication conditions, and he convergent velocity distribution of the product solution with payoffs as the independent variable is obtained.

Previous research has shown that crowdsourcing can provide quick access to distant knowledge at relatively low costs, when compared to other forms of innovation governance such as internal sourcing or contract research. Recent studies, however, indicate that firms differ considerably in their ability to reap the benefits from crowdsourcing. Drawing upon recent work on the microfoundations of capabilities, we hypothesize how three types of lower level organizational elements may affect gains from crowdsourcing: informal organizational roles, formal organizational roles, and knowledge processes. Following a mixed-method research design and drawing on rich quantitative and qualitative data, we find that informal and formal organizational roles work through processes of knowledge articulation and codification in developing a firm’s crowdsourcing capability. By going beyond the direct effects of the three antecedents, our research sheds light on the process of capability development for Open Innovation.

In addition, the moderating roles of environmental dynamisms and competitiveness in the relationships between innovation climate and inbound and outbound OI are analyzed. To achieve these goals, this paper develops an integrative research model, which analyses the network relations using covariance-based structural equation modeling (SEM) on a data set of 429 Spanish SMEs. Results revealed that organizational factors such as commitment-based human resources practices have a positive influence on innovation climate and that innovation climate contributes to both inbound and outbound OI. Another important finding is that contingent factors such as environmental dynamism strengthen the positive effect of innovation climate on outbound OI.

This article proposes to shift the conceptual frame from looking at the tensions between control and openness as problems to looking at them as synergies.

OI adoption could result in the enactment of several OI modes – each representing an opportunity of potential change (of market, of technology or/and of the organisation) – and this paper attempts to examine the relationships between the CEO characteristics and each of the OI modes. Our analysis, using Korean SME data, shows that CEOs’ positive attitude, entrepreneurial orientation (EO), patience and education can play important roles in facilitating OI in SMEs. However, this paper also observed that the effects of CEO characteristics on OI adoption were differently configured according to the nature of each OI mode, for example, CEOs’ patience and EO had different impacts depending on the degree of uncertainty in the OI mode. This suggest that OI must be understood as a wide innovation spectrum, and, to increase opportunities for successful OI adoption, CEOs have to attempt to compensate for characteristics they may lack by recruiting appropriate complementary top managements.

Rigorous statistical techniques, including exploratory factor analysis, reliability testing, and regression analysis were used to investigate the hypothesis. The study empirically documents a positively significant impact of service quality (tangibles, empathy, reliability, and responsiveness) on customer loyalty, while assurance shows an insignificant relationship. Furthermore, the study does not find any significant relationship between customer loyalty and the financial performance of Bangladeshi Islamic Banks.

Using a sample of 327 Chinese manufacturing firms in strategic emerging industries, we find that a firm's innovation niche within an Open Innovation ecosystem has a positive impact on its exploratory and exploitative innovations, and we demonstrate that these relationships are mediated by the innovation ecological network. Additionally, we find that the innovation ecological environment moderates the relationship between a firm's innovation niche and the innovation ecological network. Furthermore, we show that the innovation ecological environment moderates the indirect effects of a firm's innovation niche on its exploratory and exploitative innovations via the innovation ecological network.

To find such risk measures in newsvendor problems, we review various risk measures of risk-averse inventory models and existing articles in inventory management literature. Then we provide a logical reasoning and axiomatic framework to evaluate validity of each risk measure in newsvendor problems - consistency to the four axioms in coherent risk measures.

Research results support a positive relationship between LPO and SMEs' innovation performance, and a positive relationship between LSI and SMEs' innovation performance and a positive relationship between LSI and LPO. In addition, research results show that when measured by R&D intensity, SMEs' absorptive capacity weakens the positive effects of LPO (and LSI) on SMEs' innovation performance, whereas when measured by IT adoption, SMEs' absorptive capacity strengthens the two positive relationships. Relevant theoretical and managerial contributions are discussed. ",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.038,0.015,0.019,-0.03,-0.106,-0.016
149,"In this paper, we study the influence of innovator roles in highly innovative ventures. In order to obtain a differentiated picture we take into account the degree of innovativeness as a moderating variable. To test our hypotheses we use a sample of 146 highly innovative new product development projects. We choose a rigorous sampling design and apply state-of-the-art measures for the degree of innovativeness. Furthermore, we apply multi-trait-multi-method methodology (MTMM) to enhance the validity of our study. The results show that innovator roles have a strong influence on innovation success but these influences are positively and negatively moderated by innovativeness. The moderating influences depend on the type of innovativeness. Remarkably, with increasing technological innovativeness innovator roles which create inter-organizational links with the outside world appear to be more important than intra-organizational linker roles, and support from high-ranked organizational members turns out to have a significant negative effect on project success with higher degrees of technological innovativeness. Possible explanations for these findings are discussed and consequences for innovation research and innovation management are shown.

To perform this analysis, we introduce an initial framework based on three dimensions: the launching of SPs, the role of SPs in promoting OI, and the role of SPs as PP vectors for promoting OI. Following a qualitative study based on visits, archival analysis and interviews with SP professionals located in Brazil and Portugal, we may report that SPs promote OI by spontaneous mechanisms, deliberate actions, and as PP vectors. Furthermore, PPs promote OI in SPs both directly and indirectly. In our comparative analysis, we take into consideration the differences between the two countries. We also introduce a framework that integrates PPs, OI and SPs. As a practical implication, our framework serves to enact better PPs for SPs and thereby promoting more efficient OI.

152,"Inbound Open Innovation (IOI) has become a potentially valuable means of gaining competitive advantage and enhancing organizational performance. This article explores how knowledge infrastructure capability (KIC) affects IOI through the moderating role of absorptive capacity. This research conceptualizes and develops three dimensions of KIC (technological, structural and cultural), and tests the relationships between KIC, absorptive capacity and IOI. Data for the study were collected from 125 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) based in France, and the relationships proposed in the framework were tested using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results indicate that higher levels of KIC can lead to enhanced absorptive capacity and improved IOI. That is, KIC can have a direct, positive impact on absorptive capacity and IOI. Moreover, absorptive capacity partially mediates the linkage between KIC and IOI. The article contributes to the conceptualization of the impact of KIC on IOI, by emphasizing a firm’s absorptive capacity. It offers a validated instrument to measure KIC, and provides an empirical evidence of the impact of KIC on absorptive capacity and IOI. This article also extends the extant literature by focusing on KIC and absorptive capacity simultaneously in a model to understand the notion of IOI in the SMEs based in France. This study offers useful guidance for measuring and implementing KIC in a SME context and encourages further research in this area.

The effective governance of firms' ego-centered innovation networks to facilitate and accelerate inbound Open Innovation practice is the main concern of scholars and firm leaders. In this paper, we elucidate the impact of network embeddedness on inbound Open Innovation practice by considering technology cluster an important moderator. We conduct a patent citation network analysis and a hierarchical regression analysis to empirically study the patent citation data of four emerging high-tech industries according to the stages of their industrial technology development. Our results show that during the initial and growth stages of industrial technology development, the centrality and network reach of a firm's network embeddedness exert a positive impact on the inbound Open Innovation practice. This relationship is positively moderated by clustering and the bridging ties of the technology cluster in which the firm is involved. During the stable stage, only the network reach improves firms' inbound Open Innovation practice, while centrality becomes a hazard. Furthermore, clustering decreases the negative effect of centrality and enhances the positive effect of network reach. Bridging ties show no moderating effect. Our findings deepen the understanding of scholars and practitioners regarding how inbound Open Innovation practice varies in different innovation network settings at both the firm and cluster levels.

Much like traditional corporations that subscribe to the closed innovation paradigm, novel organizational arrangements targeting Open Innovation, such as small-firm networks, employ boards to effectively manage joint research-and-development activities. These boards are similar yet different from traditional corporate boards; as such, they may have different requirements for proper functioning. We use 5-year longitudinal data on 53 Swedish strategic small-firm networks to investigate how the boards should be organized to help improve the innovative status of network participants. We expand the set of tools available for effective organization of the boards' operations and emphasize the effects of network board continuity (rates of renewal) on network members' innovative performance.

Convergence presents a particular context for innovation and technology management, as firms face new bodies of technological and market knowledge which may create competence gaps. This paper asks the following question: what kind of innovation strategies do players with different industry backgrounds employ to address new industry segments resulting from industry convergence? By analysing three different industry cases of convergence, this paper explores how firms in different industries address competence gaps they face by positioning themselves in a newly emerging value chain. Empirical findings indicate that the innovation strategies which firms follow in converging industries may create conflicts with existing path-dependencies. Hence, to overcome these conflicts, Open Innovation built on dynamic capabilities (like alliance building) plays a major role in industry convergence.

Drawing on the design and results of this project, we review the bases of sociability on the Web by taking account of grassroots movements and new hybrid models of interaction on social networks, both on- and offline. Building on these experiences and a critical analysis of them, we consider ways to nudge towards open-innovation processes in higher education institutions by taking the dynamics of participation in the Social Web as the point of reference. In particular, two cases of socioeducational innovation stemming from the actions implemented while the project was running are conceptualised: firstly, the institutionalisation of participatory logics and, secondly, community-based dynamics.

In order to innovate, there needs a circumstance where ideas can overflow as many as possible, and to look at the problem from various perspectives to find possible solutions. In this context, some discussions have arisen on how to effectively communicate and share ideas between client and agency. It is expected that collaborative workshop model can become an appropriate solution for this object. It is necessary to define a new relationship between client and agency conducive to solve design problems. To such a degree, collaborative workshop would be an effective method for achieving Open Innovation. This research was conducted on this key question - How the client and agency as collaborative partner can co-create innovation? How the collaborative workshop can influence the Open Innovation? What is the purpose of collaborative workshop? What is the process would be like? How the collaborative workshop can influence the relationship between client and agency? The research framework is as follows. Based on a literature review on the issue of collaborative workshop for Open Innovation, three case studies of collaborative workshop were conducted.

163,"Integrating insights from the strategic goal literature and the knowledge-based view of the firm, this article proposes that the pursuit of social and economic strategic goals by commercial firms affects their innovation performance through different knowledge sourcing activities. The strategic goals, knowledge sourcing practices, and innovation performance of 1257 Belgian firms are investigated. Results show that both social and economic strategic goals are associated with the use of external information sources, but only the pursuit of social goals inspires firms to engage in external collaboration. No evidence is found of an inherent conflict between social and economic strategic goals. Instead, the two types of goals are independent of each other, that is, an emphasis on social goals does not preclude an emphasis on economic goals and vice versa. Moreover, firms’ external knowledge sourcing and innovation performance benefit most when strongly held social goals align with strongly held economic goals. These findings offer new insight into the nature and the effects of goal multiplicity among commercial firms. They open up a new perspective on the potential positive effects of the joint pursuit of social and economic strategic goals instead of seeing them as inherently conflicting, as past research has typically done. We illustrate how social strategic goals can deliver unique benefits to a firm, independently of and in addition to economic strategic goals. Our findings also contribute to the Open Innovation literature by revealing strategic goals as a driver of firms’ knowledge sourcing practices. Our findings suggest that solely emphasizing economic goals may be one reason why firms struggle to implement Open Innovation practices and do not reap their full benefits.

Surprisingly, only a few researchers have put IC and OI into relation. Therefore, this paper has two main goals: providing a theoretical model that synoptically presents how IC and OI overlap and testing the theoretical model by analyzing how firms’ IC affects OI-related performance.

As the direct transfer of Open Innovation methods from the private sector to the public sector is not possible, it is necessary to develop effective ‘citizen-sourcing’ methods, which address the specific needs of the public sector, and then analyze and evaluate them from various political and management sciences' perspectives. This paper makes a two-fold contribution in this direction: i) It evaluates a novel method of monitoring relevant social media (e.g. political blogs, news websites, and also Facebook, Twitter, etc. accounts) by government agencies, by retrieving and making advanced processing of their content, and extracting from it external knowledge about specific domains of government activity or public policies of interest, in order to promote and support Open Innovation; ii) For this purpose it develops a multi-perspective evaluation framework, based on sound theoretical foundations from the political and management sciences, which can be of wide applicability; it includes three evaluation perspectives: a political perspective (based on the ‘wicked’ social problems theory from the political sciences), a crowd-sourcing perspective (based on previous management sciences research on crowd-sourcing) and a diffusion perspective (based on Roger's diffusion of innovation theory from management sciences). The above evaluation provides interesting insights into this novel method of promoting and supporting Open Innovation in the public sector through social media monitoring, revealing its capabilities and strengths, and at the same time its problems and weaknesses as well, and also ways/interventions for addressing the latter.

Moving from the traditional closed innovation model toward an OI model for software development tools shows the potential to increase software development competence and efficiency of organizations. We report a case study in software-intensive company developing embedded devices (e.g., smartphones) followed by a survey in OSS communities such as Gerrit, Git, and Jenkins. The studied branch focuses on developing Android phones. This paper presents contribution strategies and triggers for openness. These strategies include avoid forking OSS tools, empower developers to participate in the ecosystem, steer ecosystems through contributions, create business through differentiation, and create new ecosystems. The triggers of openness are from 30 different companies with examples. Finally, openness requires a cultural change aligned with strategies and business models.

Innovation is a complex process, which is difficult to measure in an objective manner. In this work and for the first time, a quantitative measure for Open Innovation has been developed and validated to determine the performance of a firm within the marine biotechnology sector in Oman. This breakthrough was achieved in four steps. First, the characteristics of the two dimensions of Open Innovation (‘breadth’ and ‘depth’) were identified using a critical review of the literature and a series of pre-tests of a survey design with industrial experts. Second, a quantitative index for Open Innovation by measuring these two dimensions at firm level was developed. Third, validation of this five-item scale was conducted using the UK Community Innovation Survey (CIS) data set. Fourth, the five-item scale was applied to 22 firms in the marine bio-industry sector in Oman using a case study approach, and was used to rank the firms according to their Open Innovation index. This analysis shows how Omani marine bio-industry firms could strengthen their Open Innovation efforts, for example by collaborating more effectively with government organizations and research institutes to thereby boost the quality of their Open Innovation activities in a measurable way.

This pattern expectedly should also enhance the development of internal knowledge management capacity, which in turn is a prerequisite of firm's innovativeness. In this context, the main goal of this research is to investigate the relationship among knowledge management system, Open Innovation, knowledge management capacity and innovation capacity. To reach this goal, the research employs structural equation modelling on a sample of 298 Italian firms from different sectors. The findings indicate that knowledge management system facilitates the creation of open and collaborative ecosystems, and the exploitation of internal and external flows of knowledge, through the development of internal knowledge management capacity, which in turn increases innovation capacity.

They need to place better solutions in the market in a less time with less cost. There is a general intuition that communication and collaboration, especially mixed with Web 2.0 approach within companies and ecosystems, can boost the innovation process with positive impacts on business indicators. Open Innovation within an Enterprise 2.0 context is a one of the most chosen paradigm for improving the innovation processes of enterprises, based on the collaborative creation and development of ideas and products. The key feature of this new paradigm is that the knowledge is exploited in a collaborative way flowing not only among internal sources, i.e. R&D departments, but also among external ones as other employees, customers, partners, etc. In this paper we show how an ontology-based analysis of plain text can provide a semantic contextualization of content support tasks, such as finding semantic distance between contents, and can help in creating relations between people with shared knowledge and interests.

In its combination with seawater desalination, NPT provides a sustainable alternative for the security and economic efficiency of both energy and fresh water supply, the latter of which has been identified as “the bloodstream of the biosphere”. Integrating econometric analysis into energy research with social science ramifications, this paper relies on bivariate ordered probit regression to study the impact of youths’ interests in the biosphere on their awareness and optimism toward NPT in the UAE. The model is estimated using maximum likelihood methods, with the results showing each level increase in UAE youths’ biospheric interests, to increase their NPT awareness by 13.5%, while conjointly reducing their optimistic expectations toward the technology by 2.4%. In addition, awareness and expectations about NPT are found to vary heterogeneously across the seven Emirates of the country. Moreover, accounting for all relevant factors (including respondents’ biospheric interests), formed expectations about NPT are not significantly shaped by NPT awareness. Given that the first unit of the UAE’s nuclear power plant “Barakah” just became operational in August 2020, our results provide important insights for evidence-based policy making to sustain the nascent nuclear energy program in the long run.

We argue that engaging simultaneously in buying and selling knowledge should allow firms to increase innovation outcomes. At the same time, we identify some of the relevant costs (cognitive, transaction, and organizational costs) that ""open"" firms can reduce by combining knowledge inflows and outflows. Empirically, however, we find no evidence for such complementarity in a sample of Belgian manufacturing firms.

190,"One of the key elements of Fiat's recent resurgence is the superiority of its clean, fuel-efficient engine technologies that were mostly developed during the 1990s by Centro Ricerche Fiat (CRF), the Fiat Group company in charge of R&D and technology development. In the early 1990s, when the Italian carmaker was going through troubling times (along with many other players in the automotive industry), CEO Gian Carlo Michellone radically turned around CRF's organization and innovation strategy, adopting and mastering a strategic approach to innovation that resembles what would become known as the Open Innovation paradigm. This revolution allowed the Fiat Group to keep its ""innovation engine"" running, despite the heavy downturn of the industry. The CRF case demonstrates how Open Innovation can protect the firm's innovation capability from the risk of severe resource rationalizations during periods of crisis while proffering a starting point to replicate innovation capability once the downturn is over. The efforts to streamline the adoption of Open Innovation need to be targeted at several aspects of a firm's organization, i.e. the structures, organizational roles, the planning and control and performance management systems, corporate values, and individual competencies and attitudes.

These tasks can be done manually when there is an overseeable amount of content or by using computational tools when there are massive amounts of data. However, previous studies on text mining have not dealt with the identification of unique attributes, which can be defined as those contributions that are inextricably linked with a specific tag or category within Open Innovation websites. The uniqueness of these ideas means that they can only be obtained through a selection of one choice among several alternatives. To obtain such unique ideas and thus to also obtain innovations, this paper proposes a novel methodology called co-occurrence differential analysis. The proposed methodology combines traditional co-occurrence analysis with additional statistical processing to obtain the unique attributes and topics associated with different alternatives. The identification of unique content provides valuable information that can reveal the strengths and weaknesses of several options in a comparative fashion.

Especially the collaboration mandate is relatively unexplored in the literature. In practice, government organizations recognize the need to include external problem solvers into their internal innovation creation processes. This is partly derived from a sense of urgency to improve the efficiency and quality of government service delivery. Another formal driver is the America Competes Act that instructs agencies to search for opportunities to meaningfully promote excellence in technology, education, and science. Government agencies are responding to these requirements by using Open Innovation approaches to invite citizens to crowdsource and peer produce solutions to public management problems. These distributed innovation processes occur at all levels of the U.S. government and it is important to understand what design elements are used to create innovative public management ideas.

206,"Open Innovation contests are a popular way to tap into the creativity of customers. Many firms host multiple, successive Open Innovation contests in response to different, creative challenges they face. To encourage customers to participate and make an effort in such contests, they offer monetary rewards of varying sizes. Although prior research has investigated the optimal reward design for one-time contests, little is known about how the rewards offered in a contest can influence individuals’ ongoing level of participation and their creative effort in subsequent contests. Receiving a reward is a form of positive competence feedback that influences individuals’ feelings of competence and intrinsic motivation. Based on cognitive evaluation theory, we argue that these feelings can persist after a contest ends, influencing positively participation and creative efforts in later contests. Our online experiment and also our analysis of the data from an actual Open Innovation platform show that individuals tend to cease participating in subsequent contests, significantly reducing the size of the crowd over time. Receiving a reward and positive competence feedback alleviates this tendency. Therefore, offering more prizes motivates more high-performing individuals to participate again and to put in more creative effort, which in turn raise the average quality as well as the best quality in subsequent contests. These findings suggest that in successive Open Innovation contests, multiple rewards not only encourage greater participation, but also promote better quality outcomes. Thus, firms are well advised to expand the positive reward feedback in contests, as doing so will help them to maintain a sizable and motivated crowd of contestants.

Exposure to an increasing number of prior ideas thus heightens individuals’ perceived constraints of expressing ideas and harms creative performance (Studies 2 and 3). Furthermore, creative performance monotonically reduces with an increasing number of prior ideas (Study 4). A final study demonstrates that showing only a limited number of ideas as well as grouping prior ideas offer actionable ways to reduce prior ideas’ harmful influence (Study 5).

Effective management of the knowledge and information transferred between ecosystem partners is crucial for the process of Open Innovation. However, to date, limited research has focused on ascertaining the conditions required for knowledge transfer success, particularly where the context involves collaboration between diverse organizational actors. Correspondingly, this study extends existing knowledge by presenting an exploration of conditions for knowledge transfer success between ecosystem partners. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with thirty key stakeholders in order to acquire their perceptions of the presence of specific conditions within their ecosystem partnerships. Empirical data were analyzed using a fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis approach, resulting in the production of success recipes from multinational, small and medium-sized enterprise, and academic institution perspectives. Results indicate that combinations of knowledge, relationship, and organizational characteristics contribute to knowledge transfer success. However, these combinations are found to be dependent on the type of ecosystem partnership involved.

212,"Open Innovation efforts traditionally focus on sourcing external solutions against known needs. This approach, while helping the organization to close gaps in internal capabilities, has only limited impact on ideation and strategy. A broader awareness of technology and market trends can itself become a powerful source of new and differentiating ideas. Because of this, a systematic process for building technology awareness and articulating and disseminating knowledge within the organization is critical for enabling a collaborative cross-functional ideation process. This can be accomplished through systematic, proactive scouting and technology landscape maps, which, for a given technology domain, identify technology drivers, critical technology attributes, related existing and emerging technologies with their commercial readiness levels, and the opportunity space enabled by these technologies. We are sharing a new framework, with associated processes and tools that we developed at Kennametal. This process addresses a broader set of objectives than targeted technology searches and is versatile enough to be applied to any technology domain.  (c) Industrial Research Institute, Inc.

213,"Open Innovation has attracted a significant amount of attention from scholars and practitioners. Prior research on Open Innovation has mainly focused on collaborative inventing. However, understanding the processes and outcomes of joint inventing is not sufficient for understanding sustained open-innovation activities and the competitive advantages of the actors involved in Open Innovation. Instead, an understanding of value creation and value capture is paramount for advancing our understanding of sustained open-innovation activities. Open Innovation requires collaboration among distributed but interdependent actors who rely on each other’s capabilities for value creation and capture. Value in Open Innovation is driven not only by actors’ value creation but also by their ability to capture value. While value creation and value capture are discussed in the open-innovation literature, the advancement of this stream of research is hindered by conceptual ambiguity, especially in relation to the concept of value capture.

Open Innovation is a rich concept, that can be implemented in many different ways. The context dependency of Open Innovation is one of the least understood topics; more research is needed on the internal and external environment characteristics affecting performance. The Open Innovation process relates to both the transition towards Open Innovation, and the various Open Innovation practices. As with any new concept, initial studies focus on successful and early adopters, are based on case studies, and descriptive. However, not all lessons learned from the early adopters may be applicable to following firms. Case study research increases our understanding of how things work and enables us to identify important phenomena. They should be followed by quantitative studies involving large samples to determine the relative importance of factors, to build path models to understand chains of effects, and to formally test for context dependencies.

The paper represents a first step in overcoming this limitation. In particular, adopting a longitudinal, firm-level perspective, it addresses the following question: which changes in a firm's organizational structures and management systems does the shift from Closed to Open Innovation entail? In answering this question, the paper uses established concepts in organizational change research to look into a rich empirical basis that documents the adoption of Open Innovation by four Italian firms operating in mature, asset-intensive industries.

For Open Innovation, organizing external sources correctly is a critical capability; current literature suggests that external sources should be organized either as collaborative communities or as competitive markets. While firms have generally been slow to adopt Open Innovation, many cities in the U.S. and Europe have been quick to embrace it-providing needed field-based experience on how to organize external sources. Based on our examination of six cities opening their data for innovation, we found that while cities often started with one or the other approach to organizing their external sources, each approach was inadequate in ways that could potentially be addressed by the addition of the other approach. Thus, we conclude with an integrated approach in which the needs of the entire ecosystem of sources and supporters of innovation are organized to address both competitive and community needs.

Drawing on a database collected from 605 innovative SMEs in the Netherlands, we explore the incidence of and apparent trend towards Open Innovation. The survey furthermore focuses on the motives and perceived challenges when SMEs adopt Open Innovation practices. Within the survey, Open Innovation is measured with eight innovation practices reflecting technology exploration and exploitation in SMEs. We find that the responding SMEs engage in many Open Innovation practices and have increasingly adopted such practices during the past 7 years. In addition, we find no major differences between manufacturing and services industries, but medium-sized firms are on average more heavily involved in Open Innovation than their smaller counterparts. We furthermore find that SMEs pursue Open Innovation primarily for market-related motives such as meeting customer demands, or keeping up with competitors.

In particular, we hypothesise that domestic Open Innovation has positive effects on new-to-the-firm product innovation, due to easily accessible resources. We further posit that, through international Open Innovation, SMEs can access new and advanced knowledge which is not available locally, leading to more novel innovations. However, we expect that the relationship between openness, both domestic and international, and innovation is conditional on R&D activities. Our empirical analysis based on the Cyprus Community Innovation Survey supports these hypotheses.

This latter challenge involves a paradox, why would firms spend money on R&D efforts if the results of these efforts are available to rival firms? To explore these challenges, we examine the activity of firms in open-source software to support their innovation strategies.

The paper shows that the Open Innovation paradigm is implemented along a three-phase process that comprises the stages of unfreezing, moving and institutionalising. Moreover, it emerges that the changes through which Open Innovation has been implemented involve four major dimensions, i.e. networks, organisational structures, evaluation processes and knowledge management systems.

Since the waiving of IPRs runs counter to common views on strategy and competition and to engrained practices, this is a non-trivial question. To address it, we conduct an empirical study in a segment of the computer component industry which traditionally has taken a rather proprietary stance. With the advent of the open source operating system Linux, firms increasingly waived their IPRs on software drivers. We trace and analyze this process using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Our results indicate that component makers went through a learning process, which led some to realize how selectively waiving IPRs may be beneficial for their business. We uncover customer demand pull as the initial trigger and observe how a positive feedback loop sets in subsequently, leading to a further increase in the use of selective revealing.

This paper explores the case of a Brazilian family-owned company of rubber products, operating in the sectors of health, education, and coatings, which based on organizational sustainability uses knowledge to develop Open Innovation aiming to promote sustainable innovations. The methodology is an exploratory single case study research based on informal observation, semi structured interviews with key informants, and focus group discussions. The case study's results explore in depth the company's experience in adopting the strategic organizational sustainability using knowledge management and Open Innovation to promote sustainable innovations in accordance with the model of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development for eco-innovation, acting as a driver for significant changes in the organization's culture in organizational sustainability.

244,"Organizations build strategic alliances with other firms with the intent of tapping into partners’ resources and capturing long-term value from these relationships. Such partnerships are typically governed by contractual or equity arrangements with clear mutual obligations. More recently, however, organizations have begun to seek strategic partnerships with Open Innovation communities, which are novel digitally enabled forms of organizing, and where contractual commitments are not possible. Thus, selecting the right Open Innovation community as an alliance partner becomes a more complex decision. We follow how the organizational decision makers, in two technology firms that were pioneers of forming strategic alliances with Open Innovation communities, developed metrics around making such decisions. We build upon Shah and Swaminathan's (2008) contingency model of alliance partner selection and consider how it applies to the case of partnering with Open Innovation communities. This framework was useful in to frame our findings, yet our work recognizes and builds upon two key differences: 1) the evaluation metrics used in selecting an Open Innovation community were more focused on value creation than value capture; and 2) open ecosystem considerations, and not just partner-specific metrics, featured prominently in this type of alliance partner evaluation. We develop the notions of community and ecosystem health to refer to these new metrics. ",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.024,0.01,-0.018,-0.021,0.029,-0.003
245,"Organizations increasingly rely on external sources of innovation via inter-organizational network relationships. This paper explores the diffusion and characteristics of collaborative relationships between universities and industry, and develops a research agenda informed by an 'Open Innovation' perspective. A framework is proposed, distinguishing university-industry relationships from other mechanisms such as technology transfer or human mobility. On the basis of the existing body of research, the role of practices such as collaborative research, university-industry research centres, contract research and academic consulting is analysed. The evidence suggests that such university-industry relationships are widely practised, whereby differences exist across industries and scientific disciplines. While most existing research focuses on the effects of university-industry links on innovation-specific variables such as patents or firm innovativeness, the organizational dynamics of these relationships remain under-researched. A detailed research agenda addresses research needs in two main areas: search and match processes between universities and firms, and the organization and management of collaborative relationships.

246,"Our introduction provides the foundation and background for this special issue on Open Innovation. Since the beginning of the 21st century, innovation has evolved from being the artefact of an individual or internal process within firms to an interactive process between firms and/or in collaboration with knowledge-creating institutions at both the domestic and global levels. The Open Innovation model suggests that firms should combine external and internal ideas and technologies as effective pathways to market when advancing and commercialising technologies. However, existing research focuses mainly on high-technology multi-national firms hence, theoretically driven and empirically-based research exploring Open Innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises remains relatively scarce. This special issue offers a critical contribution to this gap with four articles which explore differing aspects of Open Innovation within smaller firms. The introduction to this special issue commences with an overview of the relevant literature; it then describes the articles and, finally, suggests potential avenues for future research.

Our analysis of a large panel of Spanish manufacturing firms confirms that the effect of the proportion of external research and development (R and D) investments on the production of patents and new products has an inverted U-shape. The results also reveal that investments in IT positively moderate the consequences of Open Innovation on innovation performance by reducing identification, assimilation, and utilization costs. Our results provide evidence of the viability and benefit of a new strategic alternative to innovation that is different than the traditional process of vertically integrated R and D.

Our empirical findings indicate that the adoption of technologically advanced strategies requiring complex legal and managerial knowledge, such as the OSS supply strategy, demands relatively highly educated employees. The support for and development of an education system providing highly skilled people from different fields are essential for the firms' successful adoption of innovative business strategies. We also find that market entrants have largely driven the OSS adoption, but there are no significant age-related differences in the adoption behavior of incumbent software firms.

Considering cognitive barriers and constrained resources and capabilities for applying Open Innovation in SMEs with unrestricted scope, a local approach offers advantages to facilitating OI.

Building upon imprinting theory, we hypothesize and find that scientists provide an advantage to innovative start-ups to the extent that they stimulate Open Innovation (i.e., search breadth and depth). However, for this to effectively occur, the involvement of multiple scientist founders is needed, so that their career imprints internalized in the lab are successfully transferred to the start-up. Moreover, if the start-up embraces business practices (i.e., strategic planning) or departs from scientific logics (i.e., pursuing non-commercial goals), scientists’ contribution is further increased. Therefore, our study illustrates how the scientist career imprint can provide an advantage to innovative start-ups with multiple scientists, but also how it can act as a rigidity if the start-up does not pursue strategic planning or emphasizes non-commercial goals.

Leveraging insights from the sociology theory and innovation literatures, we clarify whether social status helps entrepreneurial ventures overcome market imperfection and information asymmetry in out-licensing and illustrate the importance of specific aspects of social status building in this context.We also examine the effect of failure experiences on out-licensing. We take a dynamic view of desorptive capacity by studying an entrepreneurial venture's learning process, both internally, in terms of its own technology trajectory, and externally, through inter-organizational alliances. We apply a negative binomial model to our novel panel of 180 firms studied over an 18-year period with controls for stocks of clinical development activities, patenting and prior licensing activities. Empirical analysis enables us to observe the impact which the firms' technological and development status, reputation and desorptive capacity exert upon out-licensing volume. Prior outbound Open Innovation studies do not account for the heterogeneity of technology and R&D success and failure experiences observed in our study. We also demonstrate the contingency effect of external learning from alliances during the building-up of a firm's desorptive capacity, or the way in which the number of co-authoring partners in scientific publications negatively moderates the positive effect of the number of commercial alliances on the volume of its out-licensing deals.

Research has ranged from case study representations to large-scale quantitative studies using the Community Innovation Survey data or developing novel approaches to measuring Open Innovation. In this study, we conceptualise and validate a firm-level measure of proclivity for Open Innovation, which relates to the firm’s predisposition to perform inbound and outbound Open Innovation activities. To do so, we focus on smaller firms, assessing their organisational and behavioural perspectives related to Open Innovation. Building on existing scholarly research and a field study, we begin by conceptualising the theoretical framework of the multidimensional construct. We then develop and validate its measurement scale on two cross-cultural samples. The measure contains the following dimensions: inward IP licensing and external participation, outsourcing R&D and external networking, customer involvement, employee involvement, venturing, and outward IP licensing.

Thereby scholars have nearly exclusively focused on cross-boundary knowledge flows between the focal firm and (its) external collaborators. This paper argues that such a focus limits our understanding of how multi-business firms with a diverse knowledge base profit from internally applied Open Innovation practices that in turn provide complementary benefits to OI. We build on the current literature by investigating and describing OI activities that are conducted within the boundaries of the multi-business firm. Based on a multiple case study of 23 collaboration practices conducted across 14 firms, our findings reveal 5 archetypal forms of internally applied Open Innovation activities. We draw on the literature of cross-divisional innovation and crowdsourcing to highlight how these archetypes differ in terms of their purpose and underlying managerial processes. Multi-business firms regularly rely on internal practices due to lower transaction costs and for stimulating a collaborative culture. We conclude that internally applied OI practices are effectively stimulated by a combination of non-monetary reward systems and purposive integration mechanisms.",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.047,0.027,0.039,0.023,0.055,-0.038

The appropriate corporate response to open-source innovation is diffi cult to defi ne, as the risks are unknown.

Moreover, many firms have recently started to actively commercialize technologies, for example, by means of outlicensing. While some pioneering firms realize enormous benefits from this, many others experience major difficulties in managing external technology exploitation. To overcome these challenges, firms need to establish appropriate strategic technology-planning processes. Such processes include the extension of product-technology roadmapping to integrated roadmaps for Open Innovation processes, including external technology exploitation. This has a number of implications for technology managers, including the need to consider potential returns from a technology as a whole rather than from product sales alone.

IP disassembly problems may be mitigated (but not eliminated) through contingent contractual provisions at the IP assembly stage. Moreover, provisions can be made at both the assembly and disassembly stages to prepare for and benefit from subsequent IP reassembly in a sequence of project generations over time.

The internal application of Open Innovation tools broke down formal boundaries between individuals and teams. Informal communities allowed researchers to build relationships, thereby breaking informal boundaries. Easing researchers’ anxieties about collaboration, and then building researchers’ trust, in others and in the organization’s commitment to collaboration, were crucial cultural shifts.

Outside-in Open Innovation is more often practiced than inside-out. In other words, large firms are net takers of free knowledge flows, in part because they are concerned about IP protection for outbound knowledge.

262,Part of the advantages of using Open Innovation (compared to closed innovation) in corporate venturing can be explained by applying the real options approach. Open Innovation in risk-laden activities such as corporate venturing has the following advantages: (i) benefits from early involvement in new technologies or business opportunities; (ii) delayed financial commitment; (iii) early exits reducing the downward losses; and (iv) delayed exit in case it spins off a venture. We furthermore argue that these benefits do not automatically materialize.

263,"Phenotypic lead generation strategies seek to identify compounds that modulate complex, physiologically relevant systems, an approach that is complementary to traditional, target-directed strategies. Unlike gene-specific assays, phenotypic assays interrogate multiple molecular targets and signaling pathways in a target ""agnostic"" fashion, which may reveal novel functions for well-studied proteins and discover new pathways of therapeutic value. Significantly, existing compound libraries may not have sufficient chemical diversity to fully leverage a phenotypic strategy. To address this issue, Eli Lilly and Company launched the Phenotypic Drug Discovery Initiative (PD 2), a model of Open Innovation whereby external research groups can submit compounds for testing in a panel of Lilly phenotypic assays. This communication describes the statistical validation, operations, and initial screening results from the first PD 2 assay panel. Analysis of PD 2 submissions indicates that chemical diversity from open source collaborations complements internal sources. Screening results for the first 4691 compounds submitted to PD 2 have confirmed hit rates from 1.6% to 10%, with the majority of active compounds exhibiting acceptable potency and selectivity.

Against this background we explore how Open Innovation is managed at the network level for the case of the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS). Using a longitudinal case study, we report on how the ITRS deals with a technological discontinuity affecting the whole industry, namely the pursuit of an existing technological paradigm using a well-established collaborative practice set against a novel and unknown future technological paradigm to be opened up in parallel, even though the necessary knowledge about the ensuing disruption is lacking. This challenge is characterized not only by extreme technological uncertainty, but also by partner-related and procedural uncertainty concerning the key activity of ITRS, namely the setting of future technological milestones (roadmapping). We discuss attempts by the ITRS network to overcome these uncertainties and manage technological discontinuities by extending the well-established practice of roadmapping to an unknown technological paradigm. We introduce the concept of ‘stretching practice’ to highlight this phenomenon, and we contribute to the debate on the Open Innovation and technological discontinuities that arise when venturing beyond firm-centric approaches.

Analyzing a 3 years panel dataset of German manufacturing firms obtained from Mannheim Innovation Panel (MIP) database, we find that knowledge-related obstacles induce firms to increase the scale of R&D outsourcing as well as to engage in innovation cooperation partnerships.

Our study objective was to understand how product innovation rumors are used by firms as both inflows and outflows of provisional knowledge and their effect on the innovation process. Using interview data within a high-technology firm whose forthcoming products were the subject of rumor within technology blogs, we develop propositions regarding how inflows of product innovation rumors affect innovation decisions (while addressing concerns about appropriability and intrafirm knowledge flows) and how outflows from firms may affect stakeholders outside the firm (through selective revealing and influence of technology blog editors). Product innovation rumors in part address the paradox of openness by forming an informal means of Open Innovation alongside formal processes, and we suggest further research opportunities in this domain.

273,"Purpose - Despite extensive published research into the relationship between Open Innovation activities and performance, the nature and direction of the relationship remain inconclusive. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship as to how firms' inbound and outbound OI activities, as well as their interaction influence incremental and radical innovation performance. The authors also consider the potentially mediating roles of knowledge learning and organizational capabilities in such a relationship. Design/methodology/approach - To investigate this relationship, data were collected from a cross-industry survey of 304 leading Taiwanese-based firms. Three-stage least square analysis was employed to test the model. Findings - Analyses reveal that knowledge learning and organizational capabilities mediate the OI activities-innovation performance relationship. In addition, a firm focussing on inbound activities enhances its radical innovation performance, but hinders its incremental innovation performance, while focussing on outbound activities produces the opposite effects. Among the findings, it is worth emphasizing that the effect of the interaction between inbound and outbound activities on innovation performance can be counter-productive. Research limitations/implications - The findings demonstrate that existing studies only partially explain the effects of OI activities on innovation performance. Understanding how OI activities influence innovation performance will facilitate more informed decision making, leading to more effective use of OI activities.

The results of this study fill a major gap in the current Open Innovation theory besides providing insights for practitioners. ",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.031,-0.007,-0.004,-0.029,-0.009,-0.021
276,"Purpose – The aim of this paper is to develop the conceptual design of an information and communication technologies (ICT) platform supporting the inbound Open Innovation process within the technological developments business unit of Leonardo Defence Systems. Design/methodology/approach – After a preliminary phase concerning the context analysis, methodology includes three main steps: conceptualization of functions; preliminary design; and conceptual design of the system/SW architecture. In each of these phases, the authors tried to merge evidence from the scientific literature with empirical insight emerging from the field. Findings – Results report the conceptual design proposal for an integrated ICT platform supporting the OI. It includes the conceptualization of main functions, the preliminary design deriving from use cases and the proposal for the overall system architecture and data model. Research limitations/implications – The research focuses only on the conceptual design phase; at this stage, the platform has not been still implemented or tested. Also, generalizability concerns may arise from the single-application context. Practical implications – The outcoming conceptual design can be useful for firms that open their boundaries to external partners, as well as for software developers which could draw on it. Firms approaching similar OI challenges can re-contextualize the platform to their own setting. Originality/value – Originality of this research relies on the attempt to show how ICT can support firms in their OI processes and, secondly, to support firms aiming to create a positive environment that encourages people at leveraging existing external technological opportunities and sources of knowledge. In so doing, a systematic design approach to the definition of the conceptual proposal is also pursued. ",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.058,-0.011,0.006,-0.008,0.064,-0.017
277,"Purpose – The internal resources of a firm should not be regarded as the only source of innovation; organizations need to look at the external sources which can contribute greatly. This can happen through the recent development in technologies and the emergence of social media; such advancements have empowered consumers to have social interaction with their peers in online communities. As a source of generation of innovative ideas, company-based communities have not received enough attention, although they are strong drivers for co-creation of value by customers. Easy online communication channels, facilitated through online communities, have developed Open Innovation as an attractive means of customer involvement in value creation. However, literature in this area is devoid of empirical research on the way consumers can participate in Open Innovation communities using Web 2.0 technologies. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – This paper, therefore, looks at the opportunities offered by social media to firms for Open Innovation in the context of new product development (NPD). The study is based on social support theory and the concept of social media generating Open Innovation; a model for the research has thus been proposed. The model has been tested using partial least square through an online questionnaire. Findings – The results indicate that social media is a cost-efficient way for firms to look at external sources of innovation, specifically in NPD. Online communities, developed specifically for new products, can support the innovation process for the business sector. The paper discusses the results of this empirical research and has some practical implications for practitioners in this field. Originality/value – The study indicate that social media empower individuals to come online, get involved in social interaction and share their experiences about a new product with other peers in the network. Social media and informational support, as social capital of online communities, both have influence on participation of individuals in the online communities of Open Innovation for NPD.

278,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the impact of the level of integration of management systems (IMS) over product and process innovation capabilities (IC), by considering the role of Open Innovation activities as a moderating effect of those relationships. Design/methodology/approach - A longitudinal empirical study was performed on an existing Spanish panel database that contains information related to innovation, where 9,765 companies were selected for the panel analysis. A logit approach with random effects was considered. Findings - The level of IMS positively influences process and product IC. Moreover, external cooperation, and using it to a high extent not only positively moderates the effects of the level of IMS over process IC, but also of process over product IC, where it becomes indispensable for its effect to be positive. Finally, investing in external knowledge is a positive moderator of the effects of the level of IMS over both: process and product IC. Originality/value - This is one of the first studies on empirically finding evidence of the impact of the level of IMS on process and product IC, and of the moderating effect of performing OI activities in order to achieve higher process and product IC through the IMS.

279,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the composition of skillsets in biotechnology from the perspective of employers and its relation to Open Innovation processes in the sector. It provides conclusions for HR management practice. Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on job advertisements content analysis and in-depth interviews with chiefs of research and development companies. It uses biotechnology as an example of industry where Open Innovation practice implementation is expanding. The authors have used data from American, British and Russian job search engines. Findings - It is demonstrated that skills composition required in biotechnology does not vary significantly among selected countries as the market becomes increasingly globalized in terms of not only technology used but also personnel hired. Companies stress more on hard and digital skills, while soft skills appear to be a “must have without saying,” The mismatch between skills presented in the advertisements and articulated in the interviews has been found as employers tend to demonstrate innovation friendly company culture for possible applicants. Originality/value - The present paper enriches literature on employee skills for Open Innovation. It gives comprehensive lists of biotech skills in-demand divided into hard, digital and soft categories and interprets them within the context of employee cognition and behavior. The new insight into employee skills articulated by the companies as a strong element of organizational culture is presented. ",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.032,-0.038,-0.019,-0.025,0.008,-0.003
280,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationships between the openness of firms and their innovation and financial performances. Design/methodology/approach – In order to investigate such relationships, data on inbound and outbound Open Innovation processes and performances of 110 worldwide top research and development (R&D) spending bio-pharmaceutical companies are collected via the consolidated annual reports and the PATSTAT database. The time period of the analysis is 2008-2012. Findings – Regarding innovation performances, R&D productivity and revenues to patents ratio decrease with openness, whilst patents growth is not influenced by OI adoption. As to financial performances, sales growth exhibits a positive trend with openness, while operating profit and turnover decrease with OI adoption. Particularly, an inverted U-relationship with inbound and a U-shape one with outbound are observed as of operating profit. Research limitations/implications – The study adds to the knowledge about the effect of openness on firms’ performances, a topic of increasing interest to academics, managers and policy makers. Both inbound and outbound facets of the phenomenon are taken into account. Practical implications – Understanding how openness affects performances enables more informed decision making by managers, leading to a more effective use of OI activities. Originality/value – The work provides new insights as to what “being open” means for a company, gauging both inbound and outbound transactions after a pecuniary perspective.

281,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate the connection between university research and technological capital developed by science park (SCP) firms in order to elucidate whether the causal linkage is owing to non-pecuniary research spillovers or pecuniary technology transfer activities.Design/methodology/approach – Two publicly available surveys, one dealing with the research and transfer activities of 45 Spanish universities and another with the patenting activities of 44 Spanish SCPs, are matched in such a way that hypotheses can be tested using regression analysis.Findings – The patenting performance of SCP firms is positively related to the competitive R&D projects undertaken by the universities to which they are affiliated and negatively related to the technology transfer activities carried out by those universities. These findings suggest that the scientific knowledge produced by universities principally contributes to private technology-based firms’ technological capital through non-pecuniary research spillovers, whereas the pecuniary technology transfer agreements remain uncertain or may even prove to be detrimental.Practical implications – Firms that are considering locating or remaining in a university-affiliated SCP should be aware that the university’s pecuniary orientation when managing its intellectual capital may become a barrier as regards the firm filling its technological capital shortages. From a university administrator perspective, the complementary or substitute role of technology transfer offices vis-à -vis SCPs should be considered in the light of the selling or revealing approach adopted by the university in order to commercialize and diffuse potential inventions.Originality/value – This study contributes to existing literature by shedding light on the causal linkage between university research and firm innovation, obtaining evidence in favor of an upstream, non-pecuniary and revealing role of universities in support of the accumulation of technological capital amongst SCPs tenant firms.

282,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate the innovation performance in the Hungarian food chain using the concept of Open Innovation. Design/methodology/approach – Empirical analysis is based on the data from a 2014 survey of more than 300 small- and medium-sized agricultural producers, food processors and food retailers. The authors analyse innovation performance taking into account not only the direct impacts of external knowledge inflows and absorptive capacity, but also the indirect effect of external knowledge inflows mediated by the existence of potentially complementary internal resources (absorptive capacity). The authors determine the impact of Open Innovation and a company’s absorptive capacity on innovation performance employing two stage approaches. First, the authors apply a semi-non parametric probit model. Second, the authors run cluster analysis to categorize companies based on their Open Innovation, absorptive capacity, firm and managerial characteristics. Findings – Results imply the openness along the food chain may decrease the introduction time of innovation in all areas of innovation, as well the innovation propensity. The openness towards competitors may decrease the introduction time of innovation with regard to technological innovation, but it may increase with regard to product innovation, as well the innovation propensity. The absorptive capacity decreases the introduction time of technological product, organizational and market innovation. There is a positive relationship between the use of external knowledge (when it is defined as openness with competitors) and own innovation capacity with regard to innovation propensity, but not when it is defined as openness along the food chain. The enterprises of the sample are dividing into two groups: innovative (dominated by processors) and not innovative ones (dominated by producers and retailers). Research limitations/implications – Some limitations of the paper are worth mentioning. The study is limited in its scope with regard to the research setting and the unit of analysis (Hungarian food chain). With regard to the former, our sample consists of 302 SMEs along the food chain, almost equally distributed as producers, processors and retailers. At the end of 2014 in Hungary there were 7,766 producers, 2,681 processors and 6,420 retailers in this category, which means 1.3 – 3.7 per cent coverage (Agrárgazdasági Kutatóintézet, 2014). Regarding the latter, the paper defines food chain in a narrow sense (three levels); therefore, the results represent the perspectives of a limited number of food chain partners (producers, processors, retailers). Were the definition to be widened, input from additional members would be necessary (such as suppliers of suppliers, customers of customers, third parties or competitors). Nevertheless, although the scope may be narrow, it is appropriate for our objective. Future research is recommended to overcome the paper’s limitations (i.e. extend its scope to other countries, sectors and levels of chain). Practical implications – The analysis provides valuable inputs for policy makers and SMEs along the food chain that wish to build and improve (open) innovation system. Policy makers would need more targeted innovation development programmes in order to solve the tight innovation bottlenecks. These programmes should target first of all at expanding the absorptive capacities of the food chain’s enterprises. The authors also need further research in order to investigate how much the restricted use of Open Innovation systems in the Hungarian food enterprises is linked to the cost and benefits of creation such systems. Originality/value – The authors analyse innovation performance taking into account not only the direct impacts of external knowledge inflows and absorptive capacity, but also the indirect effect of external knowledge inflows mediated by the existence of potentially complementary internal resources (absorptive capacity).

283,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate the long-term financial effects of Open Innovation in the manufacturing industry. Design/methodology/approach – Drawing upon an Open Innovation literature, this study examined 671 Open Innovation announcements made by firms listed on the New York Stock Exchange and National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations during 2003-2012. By employing the event study, the long-term financial performances of the firms that announced Open Innovation were measured using six dependent performance variables (ROA, ROS, Tobin’s Q, Cost ratio, Sales growth, Asset turnover). Findings – The results indicate that Open Innovation in the manufacturing industry may lead to long-term improvements in firm profitability, triggering a positive reaction by stockholders. Open Innovation also decreased production costs and increased sales volume over the long run. In all, Open Innovation was found to be beneficial to the firm in terms of profitability, production process improvement, and market benefits. Originality/value – This paper is the first longitudinal empirical study to investigate the long-term effects of Open Innovation in terms of US manufacturing financial performance.

284,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a systematic approach to exploring potential partners for Open Innovation in order to facilitate the process of technological collaboration.Design/methodology/approach - The proposed approach utilizes patent information that is considered the most effective data to investigate innovation activities by applying morphology analysis (MA) and generative topology map (GTM) to the process to identify the configurations of technologies and visualize the collected patent information. In particular, diverse informative indices can assist researchers in deriving appropriate partners for technological cooperation.Findings - The hybrid approach that combines MA, GTM, and indices is useful to discover technological opportunity, identify necessary technologies and explore potential partners. The systematic process can overcome the limitations of existing approaches that depend on the insights and strategic decisions of top management, reflect a superficial relationship among firms and mostly fail to consider both theoretical and practical approaches to retrieve potential partners.Practical implications - The results of this paper will help practitioners, academic researchers, and policy makers link a pair of partners who can maximize the synergy of collaboration in a systematic manner. The proposed approach is illustrated to show the validity of the process with a case of light emitting diode (LED) technology. In addition, the social cost for collaboration can be reduced by applying the proposed approach in Open Innovation.Originality/value - This paper tackles the important issue of exploring appropriate partners by applying a systematic approach that utilizes text mining, MA and GTM because existing research mostly deals with ad-hoc processes. The proposed approach utilizes multiple methodologies of data mining and technology forecasting to derive promising technology areas in a systematic manner and then employs critical indices to explore proper partners. Thus, this approach considers both quantitative and qualitative methodologies to suggest a sophisticated tool for successful Open Innovation. Moreover, a real case - LED case was illustrated to demonstrate that the proposed approach can be employed to implement technological cooperation.

285,"Purpose – The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of Open Innovation, especially focusing on technological M&A, on subsequent innovation and changes to the firm’s core technological portfolio. Design/methodology/approach – The study suggests three types of core technological areas, based on prior focus and experience in technological categories. These are 1) the existing core area, in which the acquirer firm retains its knowledge and expertise, 2) the enhanced core area, where knowledge and expertise in the acquirer firm’s insufficient areas are strengthened, and 3) the new core area, i.e. new knowledge fields in which the acquirer firm ventures into. The study then analyzes the effects of two key knowledge characteristics of the target firm, similarity and complementarity, on post-M&A innovation outcomes in each of the three core technological areas. Findings – The results confirm that while none of the investigated knowledge characteristics of the target firm is advantageous for post-M&A innovation outcomes in existing core areas, similarity of the target firm does facilitate post-M&A innovation outcomes in enhanced core areas. Moreover, the results confirm that complementarity of the target firm is beneficial for post-M&A innovation outcomes in new core areas. Originality/value – The study explains the reconfiguration mechanism of a firm’s core technological portfolio. It also suggests an extended framework to analyze innovation outcomes in more detail. Moreover, the study helps to explain why most M&As result in failure. ",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.068,0.094,-0.009,0.052,0.035,-0.071
286,"Purpose – This paper aims to increase understanding of how firms can more effectively identify valuable and profitable innovations in the pharmaceutical industry and to identify the issues and challenges posed by current managerial decision-making practices. Design/methodology/approach – A case study of a single project is presented: a drug in-licensing decision made by a team of three managers in a large Australian pharmaceutical firm. Using participant-observation, interviews and archival analysis, the authors followed the managers as they identified and evaluated 122 late-stage anti-diabetic drug variants for further development. Findings – The managers used decision heuristics to arrive at a short list of three drugs from a choice set of 122. While the process was ostensibly rational and systematic, there was evidence of data quality issues, misleading mental models and cognitive bias. The authors concluded a high probability of accepting a poor candidate or rejecting a stronger candidate (i.e. making Type I and II errors). Research limitations/implications – This paper focuses on initial market and technology evaluation stage only (i.e. not commercialization) and is a single case study design; therefore, care should be taken in generalizing to other decisions or other contexts. This paper highlights the need for further research integrating organizational decision-making and Open Innovation from a multi-disciplinary perspective. Practical/implications – This paper raises awareness of potential decision-making pitfalls and includes a detailed audit framework to support improved managerial decision processes and double rather than single loop learning. Social/implications – The findings support better decision-making and therefore supports higher quality drug selection and development, leading to improved population health outcomes.

288,"Purpose Firms often encounter complicated external relationships and conflicts in inbound and outbound Open Innovation. Conflict management significantly affects innovation results. Guided by resource dependence theory (RDT), this study aims to examine the moderating effects of conflict management styles in the relationship between OI and organizational performance (OP). Design/methodology/approach This study focuses on manufacturing and service firms in China, with the respondents composed of senior managers. Using hierarchical regression analysis, data from 270 firm samples are used to empirically test the hypotheses. Findings Inbound and outbound OI openness positively affects OP. Cooperative conflict management positively moderates the relationship between inbound OI openness and OP, whereas it negatively moderates the impact of outbound OI openness on OP. By contrast, competitive conflict management positively moderates the relationship between outbound OI openness on OP. Research limitations/implications Guided by RDT, this study explores the relationship between OI and OP and the moderating role of conflict management styles. However, it does not measure the level of resource dependence, which is among the future research directions for further validating the results of this study.

289,"Purpose From the organisational perspective, the authors know that management, including innovation management, becomes less organised by bureaucracy and administrative tools, and much more impacted by organisational capabilities, competences and hidden, soft routines, bringing innovation and creativity to the core of organisation. The purpose of this paper is to focus on competency sets for Open Innovation and is to provide recommendations for OI competency development in companies, linked to the core OI processes. Design/methodology/approach The research is exploratory and aims at theory-based practical indication combining deductive identification of competency clusters and inductive model development. Thus, the authors apply quantitative methods to data collection and analysis. The authors conducted an extensive literature review on competence challenges with regard to execution of OI, and empirical data analysis based on a large-scale structured industrial survey in Europe (N=264), leading to the development of competency sets for companies. SPSS tools are applied for empirical tests. Findings The authors develop a generic OI competency model applicable across industries, combined with organisational implications for sustaining OI management capabilities. The research clusters competencies based on the empirical analysis, which addresses the various challenges of OI, leading to recommendations for competency management in an OI context. Research limitations/implications The data were collected from one key informant per company. Although the authors made efforts to ensure that this was a senior manager responsible for innovation, the authors cannot exclude some bias in the way that OI activities and related competencies are perceived. Exploratory nature of the research, which calls for a more systematic investigation of the OI activity modes and the OI competencies resulting competency model. In particular, the competencies could be tested on an inter-professional sample of employees with involvement in and/or responsibility for innovation, development, and HR management, as well as on leaders of innovating companies. Third, although significant in size for the analyses undertaken, the sample is not large enough to enable a more fine-tuned analysis of regional differences across Europe in the way that OI is managed through the development and implementation of competencies. Practical implications The research contributes to the OI management field with an outlined OI competency profile that can be implemented flexibly and tailored to individual firm's needs. It brings indications for both further theory building and practice of innovation organisation, especially with regard to human resource development and organisational capability building for OI. Social implications The social implications of the paper result from the contribution to innovation management competency development in OI regimes, which is an important tool for designing contemporary educational programmes, contributes to OI management sophistication in business which is especially important during the economy slowdown and search for new sources of growth and productivity, and supports firms productive engagement in OI ecosystems and collective technology upgrading towards higher societal benefits and stakeholder involvement. Originality/value An empirically grounded OI competency model is proposed with an implication to support human resource development for OI. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there has been no prior attempt to build such a model.

290,"Purpose In an increasingly turbulent and competitive environment, Open Innovation could be critical for a firm's success, favoring organizational flexibility and accelerating innovation processes. However, sharing innovation projects with external partners often requires changes in traditional organizational behavior and visions of CEOs. The purpose of this paper is to theorize and empirically verify how the CEO turnover and some socially relevant characteristics of the old and the new CEO may impact firms' propensity toward Open Innovation under an integrated agency-resource dependence view and social identity perspective. Design/methodology/approach The empirical analysis was carried out on 264 companies drawn from 16 developed European markets included in the S&P Europe 350 Dow Jones index over the years 2006-2015. To test the predictions, the authors adopted regression analysis by employing the panel two-stages least squares model and the ordinary least squares econometric model. Findings Consistently with the predictions, the authors found that CEO turnover stimulates Open Innovation. Particularly, the results suggest that the organizational identity rationale may motivate a divergent propensity between insider and outsider new CEOs, with outsiders more prone to Open Innovation. The higher tendency of new outsider CEOs to undertake innovation projects jointly with external organizations prevails also within firms that experienced a long tenure of the former CEO, thereby suggesting that a new outsider CEO appears able to renovate corporate strategic directions also in highly orthodox organizational cultures. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that theorizes why CEO turnover might impact the propensity of the firm toward Open Innovation. The authors use an integrated agency-resource dependence perspective, and the results from the empirical analysis mostly support the predictions. Moreover, the authors adopt the social identity theory to show that the organizational identification of the CEO matters in the decision of engaging in Open Innovation.",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.053,0.01,-0.019,-0.012,-0.0,-0.042

Thus, the purpose of this paper is to explore the influence of technological capabilities on Open Innovation and consequent impact on perceived operational performance of the SMEs in Malaysia by considering the moderating effect of environmental dynamism. Design/methodology/approach This study is quantitative in nature and used a survey questionnaire to gather responses from 202 SME owners in Malaysia. The data were analyzed with SmartPLS software, as it used structural equation modeling. Findings The results show that technological capabilities significantly influence Open Innovation whereas Open Innovation plays an instrumental role to achieve operational performance of the SMEs. Interestingly, environmental dynamism was found to have a negative moderating role in the relationship between Open Innovation and perceived operational performance. Practical implications This paper will assist SME managers in making effective decisions while using technological capabilities and Open Innovation practices.

292,"Purpose Patents as one of the important components of intellectual capital are emerging as a new source for mining insights on Open Innovation practice of the organizations. Their role in value creation through collaboration and the inter-firm differences is yet to be explored in depth. Design/methodology/approach To achieve the aim, survey data is analyzed to rank OI practices (collaboration) of the firms, while patent data are analyzed to carry out descriptive and bivariate analysis to study the inter-firm differences in collaboration. Findings The survey findings highlight mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and patent pooling as the top two preferred modes of OI, while from patent data M&A has emerged as a predominant OI practice for mainly nonresident firms. At the firm level characteristics, out of firm age, number of granted patents and firm size, firm age has been found to be somewhat significant in few cases of OI practices.

294,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the processes of Open Innovation in the context of a fraudulent organization and, using the infamous Bernie L. Madoff Investment Securities fraud case, introduces and elaborates upon the concept of dark Open Innovation. The paper's conceptual framework is drawn from social capital theory, which is grounded on the socio-economics of Bourdieu, Coleman and Putnam and is employed in order to make sense of the processes that occur within dark Open Innovation. Design/methodology/approach Given the self-evident access issues, this paper is necessarily based on archival and secondary sources taken from the court records of Madoff v. New York - including victim impact statements, the defendant's Plea Allocution, and academic and journalistic commentaries - which enable the identification of the processes involved in dark Open Innovation. Significantly, this paper also represents an important inter-disciplinary collaboration between academic scholars variously informed by business and history subject domains. Findings Although almost invariably cast as a positive process, innovation can also be evidenced as a negative or dark force. This is particularly relevant in Open Innovation contexts, which often call for the creation of extended trust and close relationships. This paper outlines a case of dark Open Innovation. Research limitations/implications A key implication of this study is that organizational innovation is not automatically synonymous with human flourishing or progress. This paper challenges the automatic assumption of innovation being positive and introduces the notion of dark Open Innovation. Although this is accomplished by means of an in-depth single case, the findings have the potential to resonate in a wide spectrum of situations. Practical implications Innovation is a concept that applies across a range of organization and management domains. Criminals also innovate; thus, the paper provides valuable insights into the organizational innovation processes especially involved in relation to dark Open Innovation contexts.

Findings FsQCA identifies combinations of factors that facilitate incremental innovations. These combinations reveal the path to implementing company policies that enable incremental innovation and foster radical innovation. Research limitations/implications The nature of the study sample means that the findings should be generalized with precaution. The most valuable implication is the identification of combinations of factors that help companies manage innovation. Originality/value Scarce literature links organizational learning factors and OI to different types of innovation. The use of fsQCA to analyze the cases also marks a breakthrough in the innovation literature.",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.039,-0.05,0.034,0.003,-0.014,-0.004
296,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to propose a new statistical approach to evaluate complex Open Innovation projects on a quantitative basis. In certain circumstances, Open Innovation entails a radical change of policy that involves various different functions of a company such as R&D, production, and management over a period of years and gives rise to mechanisms of mutual interaction with several business partners, such as collaboration with other companies, universities and R&D institutions, and new suppliers. Then, the question arises of how to measure the impact of such complex Open Innovation processes on the overall performances of companies. Design/methodology/approach A holistic case study is applied to analyze the effect of Open Innovation projects on a corporate company's stock price dynamics. The scope is to identify two different scenarios pre- and post-adoption of an Open Innovation model by a multinational company, Fujifilm. In particular, a stochastic model, namely the log-normal model, is applied along with three statistical tests: Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Cramer von Mises, and F-test for equal variances, in order to verify if the adoption of an Open Innovation model causes any significant change in the stock price dynamics of the corporate company. Findings From the findings emerges evidence that Open Innovation projects have a moderate effect on Fujifilm's stock price dynamics, but a greater improvement of the perception of Fujifilm's stock value. This enhances the management and financial literature review by offering a novel, empirical perspective on the effect of the adoption of an Open Innovation model on a corporate company's stock price dynamics. Research limitations/implications This research is limited to a single case study, but it can be extended to other stock market companies and therefore improve on the present study.

297,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to satisfy a clear gap in the main field of Open Innovation research whereabouts a very little scholarship try to analyze the mechanisms of innovative milieu down smart cities environments by applying through innovative projects that seem to support efficiently the entry of private firms and citizens in public collaborations. Design/methodology/approach The research performed an exploratory and qualitative evaluation based on the case study method built on the evaluation of organizational behavior and urban boosting innovation through smart city initiatives. In doing so, after a literature review in smart city as well in lean methodology fields, the case of Turin Smart City follows. Findings As acknowledged by international literature, the paper shows how a lean approach enables local government to define and realize smart projects and initiatives in a faster and more effective way. Particularly, the government in one of the main cities in Italy, id est Turin, combines a lean methodology with the job-to-be done approach, according a new concept of smart initiatives involving a startup mentality for the lead users which enables interesting predictions relating the human aspects of open collaborations. Research limitations/implications The specificity of this inquiry highlights valuable insights from double-gate smart cities' innovation, social and urban as well. The research is largely interpretative and exploratory and while this provides a solid scientific foundation for further research, it does not, itself, subject any hypothesis to statistical testing and validation. Originality/value Since the city approached the smart city subject in a lean way, it was able to realize some projects in a faster way. Through specific initiatives, the city acquires the ability to involve more and better all its stakeholders such as citizens, companies, and public employees, among others.

298,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to understand if and how the adoption of an Open Innovation strategy, that is acquiring externally developed knowledge, influences the innovation performance of firms and how this relationship is moderated by the recruitment of highly educated employees and the implementation of employee training activities. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted an analysis based on the results of the 2010-2012 Italian Innovation Survey and considered only manufacturing firms. Accordingly, the econometric analysis was based on 2,836 firm-observations. Findings The study reveals that acquiring externally developed knowledge positively affects the innovation performance of firms. Additionally, while the moderation effect due to recruiting highly educated employees is not statistically significant, the implementation of training activities negatively moderates the investigated relationship. Research limitations/implications The present research confirms the positive effects of the adoption of OI strategies on the innovation performance of firms and, additionally, shows that implementing employee training activities may negatively influence the abovementioned relationship. Practical implications The present study suggests that firms acquiring externally developed knowledge should be careful in performing employee training activities, since they may hinder the positive effects of adopting OI strategies.

Findings The findings confirm that Open Innovation fosters patenting activity in health care, also thanks to huge governments' expenditures in this market. Research limitations/implications The study focuses solely on European firms and it adopts a traditional linear approach. So, we cannot exclude that different dynamics may occur across European borders. Future research should address this concern by focusing on multi-country comparative studies.

300,"Purpose This paper aims to explore the ways in which firms utilise hierarchical relationships and the market system to supply and acquire intellectual property (IP) and/or innovation capabilities from sources external to the firm. Design/methodology/approach The authors conduct a field study to explore emerging governance structures for Open Innovation, using multiple data sources including documents (e.g. white papers) and interviews published by the firms studied, analysis of the firms' web-based systems (where applicable), secondary content (e.g. news articles) and elite interviews with key personnel. Findings The analysis of seven exemplars of Open Innovation reveals that inter-organisational relationships that facilitate Open Innovation can be categorised based on whether they are mediated or direct, and seek to exchange intellectual property or innovation capability. Using this categorisation, the authors present an analysis that reveals four governance structures along ten dimensions, and discuss the influence of knowledge dispersion, uncertainty and transaction costs on the emergence of such structures. The authors conclude that the appropriateness of hierarchical/market relationships or intermediaries to source IP and/or innovation capability is dependent on the information asymmetry in relation to the existence and availability of potential solutions/solvers; the suitability of potential innovation partners (solution providers and solvers); and the acquisition process for external innovations (including problem specification, solution evaluation, transfer, etc.). Research limitations/implications The research is exploratory in nature, and designed to serve as a foundation for future research efforts. In particular, the work highlights the need for research that takes an inter-organisational perspective on facilitating Open Innovation. Practical implications The research highlights the prominence of information asymmetry as a key issue in choosing and designing appropriate governance structures for Open Innovation.

301,"Purpose This paper investigates the link between Intellectual Capital (IC) and Open Innovation. Scholars worldwide consider the topics as standing alone and so they give scarce attention to the possible link between them. Managerial experiences (and few theoretical contributions), instead, hypothesize a significant role that IC can play over OI processes in order make them successful. Design/methodology/approach The methodology of a single case study is used to investigate the link between IC and OI. In particular, an OI process managed by a global company, LEGO, and named Mindstorms is rebuilt and analysed herein. Findings Intermediate results achieved by LEGO through its OI process were unsuccessful since the company had not developed its own IC (made up of relational, human and structural capital). The subsequent development of IC, instead, has driven to successful results. This suggests that if companies do not develop their IC before launching OI processes, then these processes might be not successful. Research limitations/implications One limitation is the use of a single case study. Despite this, the present article is a warning for all the companies: before launching OI processes they need to develop their IC. Originality/value To the best knowledge of the authors, this is one of the first works that deepens the investigation of the link between IC and OI. Very often, scholars investigating IC shyly refer to OI, without mentioning it, while the scholars investigating OI allude to IC, without citing it.

Specifically, it considers the relationships between sourcing knowledge from an external environment, transferring knowledge to an external environment and adopting solutions that are useful to appropriate returns from innovation. Design/methodology/approach This study analyzes the connection between the number of patent applications and the amount of OI, as well as the association between the number of patent applications and the use of BDA. Data from firms in the 27 European Union countries were retrieved from the Eurostat database for the period 2014-2019 and were investigated using an ordinary least squares regression analysis. Findings Because of its twofold lens based on both knowledge management and OI, this study sheds light on OI collaboration modes and highlights the crucial role they could play in innovation. In particular, the results suggest that OI collaboration modes have a strong effect on innovation performance, stimulating the search for RKE. Originality/value This study furthers a deeper understanding of RKE, which is shown to be an important mechanism that incentivizes firms to increase their efforts in the innovation process.

303,"Purpose This study aims to propose and test a theoretical model exploring the impact of internal and external factors of social media use by IT organisations on Open Innovation adoption with the mediating effect of knowledge management capabilities. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 200 IT firms and partial least squares structural equation modelling was used to analyse the data of this study and to test the research hypotheses. Findings The results revealed that both customer involvement in social media and top management support (TMS) for social media had a significant impact on OI adoption. However, only the relationship between TMS for social media usage and OI link was mediated by knowledge management capability. Practical implications This study stresses the importance of social media policy development for business managers to create an interactive platform for their customers to participate in the activities of the firm. Moreover, the results suggest that for developing open knowledge management capabilities, leaders must focus on and support the use of social media technologies by the firms. Originality/value Social media technologies have taken the world by storm. Organisations and individuals are influenced by the knowledge available on Web 2.0 platforms. Most of the current research has focussed on the impact of social media use on OI in developed countries, but developing nations on the Asian continent have been left out of this discussion.

305,"Purpose: As firms turn their innovation activities toward collaborating with external partners, they face additional challenges in managing their knowledge. While different modes of intellectual property right regimes are applied in closed innovation systems, there seems to be tension between the concepts of “Open Innovation” and “intellectual property rights”. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how firms best manage knowledge via intellectual property rights in Open Innovation processes. Design/methodology/approach: Following a mixed methods approach, the authors review relevant literature at the intersection of knowledge management, intellectual property rights, strategic management of intellectual property rights and the Open Innovation process. The authors identify success drivers through the lenses of – but not limited to – intellectual property rights and classify them in five distinct groups. Expending the view on Open Innovation beyond its modus operandi, the authors develop the Open Innovation Life Cycle, covering three stages and three levels of the Open Innovation process. The authors apply their findings to a case study in the pharmaceutical industry. Findings: The authors provide four key contributions. First, existing literature yields inconclusive results concerning the enabling or disabling function of intellectual property rights in Open Innovation processes, but the majority of scholars detect an ambivalent relation. Second, they identify and classify success drivers of successful knowledge management via intellectual property rights in Open Innovation processes. Third, they advance literature on Open Innovation beyond its modus operandi to include three stages and three levels. Fourth, they test their findings to a case study and show how management leverages knowledge by properly using intellectual property rights in Open Innovation. Practical implications: The findings support firms in managing knowledge via intellectual property rights in Open Innovation processes. Management should account for the peculiarities of Open Innovation preparation and Open Innovation termination to prevent unintentional knowledge drain. Originality/value: This is one of the first studies to view Open Innovation as a process beyond its modus operandi by considering the preparations for and termination of Open Innovation activities. It also addresses the levels involved in managing knowledge via intellectual property rights in Open Innovation from individual (personal) to project and firm level.

306,"Purpose: Business process management (BPM) supports the creation and capture of firm value. In a dynamic context, the current approach to BPM appears to be limited and static in the face of the challenges posed by the firm's Open Innovation ecosystem. The main purpose of this paper is to shed light on the value co-creation through the integration of OI principles and mechanisms of value system. Design/methodology/approach: To this aim, the paper suggested a conceptual integration of strategy and operations literature on OI and the firm's value creation system. This analysis adopted BPM lenses with specific attention to the alignment between value creation and value capture. Applying BPM lenses to the process of creating shared value sought the attainment of a comprehensive system of decisions articulated between strategy and operations. Findings: The paper pinpoints key links between strategy models and operational planning, thus proposing a new framework that integrates the characteristics of value system and OI. The paper elaborates a new theoretical framework rooted in the extant literature conducted in BPM, business strategy and business model innovation (BMI) fields. Originality/value: This paper aims to fill the gap in the literature in which strategy models are separately treated from the operational ones.

307,"Purpose: Currently, it is commonly accepted that information technology capabilities (ITC) positively influence organizational agility. Nevertheless, studies have recently started to demonstrate that different organizational factors mediate this relation under the controvertible assumption that companies are capable of responding quickly to market changes using their IT in combination with other internal resources. Therefore, companies have given very little attention to collaborative work with external partners. The purpose of this study is to analyze the mediating effects of the acquisition and exploitation capabilities of Open Innovation on the information technology capabilities – organizational agility relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Structural equation modeling was used to test the proposed model with survey data from a multinational corporation that operates in South American emerging economies in the pension and savings businesses. Findings: This study found that only the Open Innovation capability of exploitation has a partial mediating effect. This means that this organizational ability serves as a bridge so that IT capabilities can have a positive incidence on organizational agility. Originality/value: This paper adopts a more novel study focus that emphasizes the importance of collaborative work and of the use of external resources that are implicit in Open Innovation capability. On the other hand, this organizational ability implies external embeddedness, which is usually approached mainly from the network theory in the international business literature; however, this study offers a more interesting study focus in which externally oriented organizational abilities such as Open Innovation are more important for external embeddedness than are the size and quality of the external network.

308,"Purpose: Despite the abundance of research in Open Innovation, few contributions explore it at inter-organizational level, and particularly with a focus on healthcare ecosystem, characterized by a dense network of relationships among public and private organizations (hospitals, companies and universities) as well as other actors that can be labeled as “untraditional” player, i.e. doctors, nurses and patients. The purpose of this paper is to cover this gap and explore how knowledge is transferred and flows among all the healthcare ecosystems’ players in order to support Open Innovation processes. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is conceptual in nature and adopts a narrative literature review approach. In particular, insights gathered from Open Innovation literature at the inter-organizational network level, with a particular attention to healthcare ecosystems, and from the knowledge transfer processes, are analyzed in order to propose an interpretative framework for the understanding of knowledge transfer in Open Innovation with a focus on healthcare ecosystem. Findings: The paper proposes an original interpretative framework for knowledge transfer to support Open Innovation in healthcare ecosystems, composed of four main components: healthcare ecosystem’s players’ categories; knowledge flows among different categories of players along the exploration and exploitation stages of innovation development; players’ motivations for Open Innovation; and players’ positions in the innovation process. In addition, assuming the intermediary network as the suitable organizational model for healthcare ecosystem, four classification scenarios are identified on the basis of the main players’ influence degree and motivations for Open Innovation. Practical implications: The paper offers interpretative lenses for managers and policy makers in understanding the most suitable organizational models able to encourage Open Innovation in healthcare ecosystems, taking into consideration the players’ motivation and the knowledge transfer processes on the basis of the innovation results. Originality/value: The paper introduces a novel framework that fills a gap in the innovation management literature, by pointing out the key role of external not R&D players, like patients, involved in knowledge transfer for Open Innovation processes in healthcare ecosystems.

309,"Purpose: Despite the rising interest in eco-innovation, few studies have examined how Open Innovation actually increases eco-innovation performance. Drawing on capabilities theory, this study aims to investigate how two specific organizational capabilities (alliance management capability and absorptive capacity) individually complement OI strategies (inbound and outbound) to increase eco-innovation performance, while taking into consideration high and low levels of environmental uncertainty. Design/methodology/approach: To test the hypotheses, the authors used a primary survey and secondary proxy data sources from 232 Taiwan-based manufacturing firms. The authors collected survey data for measuring OI strategies, followed by secondary proxy data for measuring alliance management capability, absorptive capacity, environmental uncertainty and eco-innovation performance. Findings: The results indicate that in highly dynamic environments, alliance management capability complements inbound/outbound strategies to increase eco-innovation performance. However, absorptive capacity complements only inbound strategies, not outbound strategies. Practical implications: These findings have important implications for managers attempting to increase eco-innovation performance by using OI in dynamic environments. Social implications: The findings provide new evidence that configurations of OI alone are not enough for increasing eco-innovation performance. Instead, firms’ eco-innovation benefits more when OI are complemented by alliance management capability. Originality/value: This study makes an original contribution to the eco-innovation literature by demonstrating how organizational capabilities complement OI to increase eco-innovation performance in dynamic environments.

310,"Purpose: Family firms that simultaneously engage in multiple levels of innovation – incremental and radical – are likely to enjoy performance advantages across generations. The purpose of this paper is to research under which management conditions (i.e. top management team (TMT) diversity in terms of generational or non-family involvement) family firms are more likely to achieve innovation ambidexterity. Also, the paper addresses the mediating role of Open Innovation breadth in this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: A large cross-sectional sample of 335 small- and medium-sized family firms is used. The hypotheses were tested in a mediation model. The relationship between TMT diversity and ambidexterity is measured using a binominal regression analysis, the one between TMT diversity and OI breadth using a Tobit model. Findings: Drawing on the family firm upper echelon perspective, the results indicate that TMT diversity induced through external managers and multiple generations is positively related to innovation ambidexterity. As the mediation analysis reveals, the relationship can be explained by the higher propensity of diverse TMTs to get involved in OI breadth. The findings add to the discussion on family firm heterogeneity and its influence on different kinds of innovation. Originality/value: So far, few studies have been concerned with ambidextrous family firms. Contrary to their reputation, this study identifies family firms as radical as well as open innovators. As such, this research takes account not only of the heterogeneity of family firms, but also of the heterogeneity of family firm innovation.

311,"Purpose: In a world of ever-changing corporate environments and reduced product life cycles, most organizations cannot afford anymore to innovate on their own. Hence, they open their innovation processes to incorporate knowledge of external sources and to increase their innovation potential. As the shift toward Open Innovation is difficult and makes many initiatives fail, the question arises which capabilities organizations should develop to successfully implement OI. As the literature encompasses mature but isolated streams on OI capabilities, there is a need for an integrated capability framework. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: This paper proposes the Open Innovation capability framework (OICF) that compiles and structures capabilities relevant for implementing OI. The OICF covers the outside-in and coupled processes of OI. To integrate multiple streams of the OI literature, the OICF builds on a structured literature review. The OICF was also validated in a two-step review process with OI experts from academia and industry. Findings: The OICF comprises 23 capability areas grouped along the factors such as strategic alignment, governance, methods, information technology, people, and culture. To analyze the existing body of knowledge on OI capabilities, the authors compare the OICF with other OI-related capability frameworks and compile a heatmap based on the results of the literature review. The authors also discuss the experts’ feedback on individual factors of the OICF as well as on interdependencies among these factors. Practical implications: The OICF provides practitioners with a structured overview of the capabilities to consider when implementing OI. Based on the OICF, practitioners can define the scope of their OI initiatives. They can use the OICF as a foundation for prioritizing, selecting, and operationalizing capability areas as well as for deriving implementation roadmaps. Originality/value: The OICF is the first framework to take a holistic perspective on OI capabilities. It integrates mature but isolated research streams of OI. It helps practitioners define the scope of OI initiatives and academics gain insights into the current state of the art on OI capabilities.

312,"Purpose: Information technology plays a critical role in the Open Innovation process. The purpose of this study is to explore the inner mechanism of external information technology (IT) capability that affects Open Innovation performance. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, responses to 232 questionnaires from different firms were collected in China. Then, the proposed hypotheses were tested using regression analysis by statistical product and service solutions (SPSS). Findings: The results indicate that external knowledge integration plays a mediating role in the relationship between external IT capability and Open Innovation performance, openness breadth positively moderates the influence of external IT capability on external knowledge integration and openness depth negatively moderates the relationship between external IT capability and external knowledge integration. Practical implications: The results, which are based on Chinese responses, provide useful suggestions for firms in China. To use external IT capability to improve Open Innovation performance, firms should not only stress the role of external knowledge integration but also consider their search strategy. Originality/value: Both researchers and practitioners are interested in the relationship between information technology and Open Innovation. However, the way in which the inner mechanism of external IT capability affects Open Innovation performance has not been thoroughly researched.

313,"Purpose: Innovation projects are often risky and costly. But not all innovation projects lead to commercialisation; some are abandoned, and these abandoned innovation projects can be classified as a waste of resources. Therefore, this paper studies the influence of different external sources and a firm’s decision to abandon an innovation project. The purpose of this paper is to provide a broader understanding of abandoned projects. Design/methodology/approach: The data applied are quantitative data and the empirical background is the Danish Innovation Survey 2009. The sample consists of Danish manufacturing firms with ten employees or more (n=840). The results are based on logistic regression analysis. Findings: Results reveal that firms should consider that the involvement of customers can lead them to abandon innovation projects. However, if firms combine customers with universities, it will decrease the likelihood of innovation projects being abandoned. A more in-depth analysis shows that the involvement of customers from “Europe” (countries in Europe excluding Denmark) and the “US” leads to innovation projects being abandoned while customers from “other countries” (the rest of the world, including China and India) have the opposite effect. Originality/value: The contribution is to the limited literature on abandoned innovation projects by suggesting that the type of external sources is a significant factor in firms’ decisions to abandon innovation projects. The paper identifies that the involvement of certain external sources leads firms to decide to abandon innovation projects, and that the country of origin of the external sources is an important criterion to consider in relation to a firm’s decision to abandon innovation projects.

314,"Purpose: Knowledge-based organizations is a new paradigm for business. Knowledge management (KM) is important for supporting core business processes. This paper aims to define an Open Innovation-driven KM implementation for effectively executing the support. Design/methodology/approach: KM is important for supporting organizational innovation. OI plays a critical determinant role in defining the design of KM for effectively supporting OI. Further, the final goal of KM is to reach the success of OI-based KM implementation. A model is thus proposed for connecting OI as a driver to a design of KM and, in turn, KM implementation. Survey is conducted to collect data. Partial least squares is used for analysis. Findings: The three processes of OI partially present significant impact on the design of KM process and, in turn, a noticeable achievement of KM implementation. The two KM processes indicate an interaction effect for reinforcement mutually. The findings provide rich evidence into the argument that OI-based KM implementation through the mediator of the design of KM process is important for a successful KM in organizations. Practical/implications: While OI is a phenomenon that has increasingly become critical for the contemporary business, the design of KM mechanism needs to be adapted from the choice of OI process for guaranteeing the success of KM implementation. Originality/value: Extant theories did not provide such an approach to develop an effective KM implementation in terms of the important management concept, OI, in organizations.

315,"Purpose: Little research focuses on the conditions under which companies open up to co-develop knowledge with external actors. Spatial proximity has been proved insufficient to generate successful Open Innovation processes: socio-economic proximity also seems required. This paper aims at better understanding how this new form of proximity can be organized and investigates the role of third parties or tertius iungens in this process. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on an exploratory case of successful Open Innovation between a software editor and a systems integrator located in the same cluster, relying on 50 face-to-face in-depth interviews, documentation and analysis of physical artifacts. Findings: It confirms that socio-economic and in particular coordination proximity favors Open Innovation processes. This proximity is facilitated by a third party acting as a sustained iungens to initiate contact between development partners and key customers, and to practically organize knowledge transfer. The paper suggests that to be effective this tertius iungens needs to occupy a central position in the local network and to exhibit the characteristics of an epistemic community. Research limitations/implications: Due to its exploratory design, the authors' research exhibits several limitations in terms of generalization. It does not fully appreciate the specific interaction between the various dimensions of proximity and in what respect spatial proximity positively influences or reinforces the development of socioeconomic proximity. Further research is needed to analyze the relationships between these various forms of proximity and understand whether spatial proximity is required in a context where new information technologies ease up relationship and coordination mechanisms. Another limitation is linked to the character of the Open Innovation project analyzed which focused on an innovation of exploitation. Practical implications: This paper suggests that territorial engineering should favor the emergence of organizations playing the role of tertius iungens in the local network. Such organizations need to have the technical expertise and image of benevolence and integrity to manage knowledge transfer. Originality/value: Little research analyzes the role of third parties or tertius iungens in the emergence and management of Open Innovation processes. The literature on clusters has mostly highlighted that inter-organizational cooperation emerges from spatial proximity and can be organized by public authorities whereas most of the Open Innovation literature on software describes cooperation patterns that do not require any third party.

The following variables were collected from each innovative idea that was recorded: (a) level of health care where the idea originated (primary care or secondary care), (b) subject or category according to the classification of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Health Care Innovations Exchange, (c) ratings relative to each screening criteria, and (d) the result of the screening decision: stored = ideas that were poorly developed and in which it was not possible to identify their potential for innovation; susceptible of improvement = potential ideas that needed to be improved and whose authors received comments from the evaluation committee; validated = ideas that continued the process to become innovation projects; forwarded = ideas that were not innovative but they were a complaint or a proposal for quality improvement (these were forwarded to the institutional department concerned). Findings: A total of 246 innovative ideas were recorded in the period of the study, 61 (24.8%) of which were recorded by nurses. The subjects and categories of these ideas were diverse, highlighting aspects such as patient-centered care, quality improvement strategies, preventive and chronic care, and primary care. Thirty-five (57.4%) of these innovative ideas were stored, 13 (21.3%) were susceptible to improvement, 11 (18.0%) were forwarded, and 2 (3.3%) were validated. Conclusions: The results demonstrated that approximately a quarter of the ideas were recorded by nurses. Subjects and categories of these ideas were diverse, some of them closely related to the profession and nursing practice. Two ideas were identified as potential innovation projects. Innòbics can act as an organizational tool that promotes a climate for innovation in health care. Clinical Relevance: This study recognizes nurses’ contribution to a healthcare innovation initiative and their interest in sharing innovative ideas. Its findings provide useful insights into a virtual community of Open Innovation such as an organizational tool for encouraging creativity and innovation in healthcare. Likewise, there is also a need for further development of nurses to master healthcare innovation as a basic competence. ",Health Sciences,0.043,-0.051,-0.058,-0.037,-0.035,-0.08
317,"Purpose: Open Innovation communities are a growing trend across diverse industries because they provide opportunities of collaborating with customers and exploiting their knowledge effectively. Although Open Innovation communities can be strategic assets that can help firms innovate, firms nonetheless face the challenge of information overload incurred due to the characteristic of the community. The purpose of this paper is to mitigate the problem of information overload in an Open Innovation environment. Design/methodology/approach: This study chose MyStarbucksIdea.com (MSI) as a target Open Innovation community in which customers share their ideas. The authors analyzed a large data set collected from MSI utilizing text mining techniques including TF-IDF and sentiment analysis, while considering both term and non-term features of the data set. Those features were used to develop classification models to calculate the adoption probability of each idea. Findings: The results showed that term and non-term features play important roles in predicting the adoptability of ideas and the best classification accuracy was achieved by the hybrid classification models. In most cases, the precisions of classification models decreased as the number of recommendations increased, while the models’ recalls and F1s increased. Originality/value: This research dealt with the problem of information overload in an Open Innovation context. A large amount of customer opinions from an innovation community were examined and a recommendation system to mitigate the problem was proposed. Using the proposed system, the firm can get recommendations for ideas that could be valuable for its business innovation in the idea generation phase, thereby resolving the information overload and enhancing the effectiveness of Open Innovation.

318,"Purpose: Open Innovation is important for technology firms as they can use freely available resources to source creative and innovative ideas. Despite the usefulness of Open Innovation for technological advancements, few studies have focused on the role of cybercrime in affecting an organizations strategic direction. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of Open Innovation on cybercrime in technology firms. Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted on technology firms to understand the role of Open Innovation in terms of technology scouting, horizontal collaboration and vertical collaboration on cybercrime activity. Findings: The study found that there is a dilemma most technology firm’s face in having an Open Innovation strategy and how to manage cybercrime. This means that a coopetition strategy is utilized that helps to not only balance the need to have Open Innovation but also protect intellectual property. Research limitations/implications: The study has implications for emerging technology innovations that not only need to have cyber security but also harness the use of Big Data. Practical implications: Managers of technology firms need to encourage Open Innovation as a strategy but manage the cybercrime that comes from sharing too much information in an online context. Originality/value: This paper is one of the first to link Open Innovation strategy to cybercrime activity in technology firms. Thus, it contributes to the literature on Open Innovation and cyber theft and security. ",Physical Sciences,0.059,0.072,-0.02,-0.053,0.059,0.101
319,"Purpose: The authors aim to investigate the concept of Open Innovation, identify different Open Innovation practices which help describe the continuum between closed and Open Innovation, and propose a framework that suggests an association between innovation contexts and practices. Design/methodology/approach: The authors first identify the variables to describe innovation contexts and practices. Such variables are developed based on the literature and on a previous paper by the same authors in 2011. Then, they establish an association between contexts and practices, and test it through cases drawn from the existing literature. Findings: The paper proposes a detailed assessment of Open Innovation practices and suggests the association between each of them and diverse innovation contexts. A few case examples drawn from the literature prove coherent with the theoretical framework underlying the proposed association. Practical implications: The authors' results (and specifically the framework) enhance the organizations' awareness of the Open Innovation concept and the possible practices to implement it, as well as supporting managers to better select Open Innovation practices in different contexts. Originality/value: This paper discusses the concept of Open Innovation practices to enhance the comprehension of the Open Innovation concept. Also, to the authors' knowledge, the proposed association between context and practices is original in that there are no similar theoretical frameworks that help organizations selecting innovation practices.

320,"Purpose: The basic concept of transaction cost theory is that firms like to conduct transactions in a channel with lower transaction costs. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to use the transaction cost perspective to identify which conditions cause companies to choose between outbound Open Innovation (hierarchy governance) and inbound Open Innovation (market governance). Design/methodology/approach: Accordingly, transaction cost economics was used to relate the choice and implementation of Open Innovation using a sample of 250 electronics and information start-ups in China. Structural equation modeling was used to conduct confirmatory factor analysis to evaluate measurement model, while logistic regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses. Findings: As expected, the dedicated asset specificity, human asset specificity, behavioral uncertainty, transaction frequency, and small number exchange were positively associated with outbound Open Innovation. Originality/value: The contribution of this paper lies in explaining the role played by transaction cost economics in the process of Open Innovation for start-ups through empirical analysis.

321,"Purpose: The hostile environments in which museums operate force them to be innovative. Most of them have fewer resources and are publicly owned. Because these factors may hinder their innovative potential, this paper aims to propose an Open Innovation model adapted to this type of organization to improve visitors’ experience. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative method based on a thematic analysis is carried out. Data sources are: (i) focus group with stakeholders from the destination and (ii) in-depth interviews with museums experts. Findings: This new framework is important because it brings something new to a field that previous research had barely considered. The study of the implementation of Open Innovation in publicly owned small and medium-sized museums brings to light the growing importance of the relational, organizational, technological and experiential dimensions, their interactions and their main constituent factors. Research limitations/implications: The study is limited to a specific type of institution, and results should not be extrapolated to other contexts. The construct of Open Innovation is highly complex, and that advises future research to include other players. Quantitative methods and longitudinal techniques will contribute to tackling new challenges in future research works. Practical implications: Results are helpful for museum managers and policymakers. Stakeholders improve their comprehension of how an Open Innovation model works because the paper offers a few guidelines for its active designing. A solid networking based on trust and the emphasis on improving the visitor experience determine making-decision processes. Originality/value: The paper provides a systemic innovation management model for museums, where there is almost no previous research. It is theoretically supported in the Open Innovation paradigm, as well as the absorptive capacity framework.

322,"Purpose: The link between openness and innovative performance has been established as an inverted U-shape relationship, namely, the openness-performance connection is not always positive. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the concept of partner heterogeneity to characterize the influence of “quality” changes in partners on innovative performance, that is, the focus of this paper. Given that partner heterogeneity is crucial in explaining open innovative performance, it is also worth placing the examination of this key construct in emerging regions such as China. Design/methodology/approach: The sample selection of this study covers a wide range of industries, but requires that the sample firms be manufacturing enterprises with an Open Innovation strategy. With opportunities and challenges associated with partner collaboration toward Open Innovation, the Chinese province of Zhejiang has established its reputation. Thus, empirical data were collected randomly from data pool of Zhejiang Province Economic and Information Commission, as well as a survey questionnaire. Data were using a cross-sectional survey methodology encompassing diverse organizations, industries, and nations. Findings: Empirical testing of this assumption in a sample of 217 manufacturing firms indicates that partner heterogeneities, which are classified as organizational heterogeneity, industry heterogeneity, and national heterogeneity are all positively associated with innovative performance, but the strength of this association is influenced by environmental turbulence. Technological turbulence significantly and positively modulates the relationships of organizational and national heterogeneities with innovative performance. Market turbulence also plays a significant positive role on the relationship between national heterogeneity and innovative performance, while technological and market turbulence roles on the relationship between industry heterogeneity and innovative performance are not confirmed. Originality/value: This paper refines the connotative dimensions of partner heterogeneity around the core concept of partner heterogeneity in Open Innovation in the context of emerging region, China. The study presents a systematic, in-depth analysis, and verifies the impact mechanisms of partner heterogeneity in Open Innovation on innovative performance by integrating the resource-based view, organizational learning theory, and transaction cost theory.

323,"Purpose: The purpose of the paper is to introduce standardization as a neutral arena for Open Innovation. The aim is to show that different policies towards open membership in standardization initiatives lead to different Open Innovation processes. Design/methodology/approach: Two cases are used to illustrate the differences in Open Innovation processes. The cases are the Android mobile operating system and the service platform developed by the Open Mobile Alliance. The core process types introduced by Gassmann and Enkel are used to show the different Open Innovation approaches. Findings: Both cases use Open Innovation to create standards. Open membership leads to a coupled process, while a more restricted membership gives separate inside-out and outside-in processes. The case lead by established firms in the industry has a process where radical innovations are introduced early in the process, while the case lead by newcomers has a process where radical innovations are introduced late in the process. The two cases have different approaches towards commercialization of the products. Android relies on third-party developers, while the Open Mobile Alliance relies on their own members. Research limitations/implications: The cases are from the telecommunication sector and based on standardization of large technical platforms. The findings might not be the same for other sectors. Originality/value: The paper establishes Open Innovation as a neutral arena for Open Innovation outside the domain of any single firm. It shows how the openness towards membership influences the choice of Open Innovation processes. ",Physical Sciences,0.045,-0.032,-0.045,-0.028,0.059,-0.032

325,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to assess the impact of Open Innovation practices on the innovation capability and export performance of UK small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Design/methodology/approach: The empirical (quantitative) investigation is based on a sample of 64 SMEs in the UK - 33 ""open"" innovation firms and 31 ""closed"" innovation firms. Findings: The overall results demonstrate that the international competitiveness of SMEs is highly dependent on the cumulative effects and interrelationship between two key internal components, i.e. R&D capacity and managerial structure and competencies, coupled with two external factors, i.e. Open Innovation practices and the ability of the firm to attract government grants for R&D and technological development. Research limitations/implications: Owing to the size of the sample, it has not been possible to undertake research within the context of specific regional disparities and/or sectoral characteristics. Practical implications: In order to achieve and sustain competitive advantage in today's global market, SMEs need to collaborate with universities and other firms to advance and commercialise their technologies through ""Open Innovation"". Originality/value: Results show that Open Innovation activities and their impact on the international competitiveness of SMEs are complex and multi-faceted. Essentially, they are highly related to and dependent upon the cumulative effects of, and interrelationship between, several key internal and external factors.

Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on a sample of 188 entrepreneurs who answered a survey about their personality characteristics in Time 1. In time 2, the authors collected firm-related data from a national database on firms’ financial statements. Findings: The results show that an individual’s level of Open Innovation mindset has a positive impact on entrepreneurial alertness. The results also show an important and previously under-investigated relationship between entrepreneurial alertness and firm financial performance. Research limitations/implications: This study spurs research in the field of Open Innovation on the individual level of the entrepreneurs who have considerable influence on small firms’ results, and draws attention into the under-investigated innovation and entrepreneurship agenda in a small and transitioning country. Practical implications: Open Innovation starts with an Open Innovation mindset of entrepreneurs, so entrepreneurs are those who set the Open Innovation path of firms. Originality/value: While Open Innovation triggered interest among business practitioners and management innovation scholars, it remained focused on management topics connected to a broad strategic setting of a firm. However, research related to entrepreneurial companies which benefit significantly from external sources of innovation has received scarce attention, and Open Innovation on the entrepreneur’s individual level even less so.

327,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to develop and test an integrated model to examine the relationship between managerial ties and two types of Open Innovation. It takes into account the mediating role of realized absorptive capacity and explains how a firm’s ability to recognize the value of new information, assimilate it and apply it to commercial ends can facilitate OI. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 259 middle and top managers working across different sectors in the United Arab Emirates. Findings: Results obtained using structural equation modeling show that managerial ties facilitate both in-bound and out-bound OI. Results also establish the mediating role of realized absorptive capacity in these relationships. Research limitations/implications: Use of cross-sectional data as was done in this study has been criticized for being inappropriate to test causal models. Besides the findings may not be generalizable to different industries/cultures/regions. Practical implications: This study suggests that managerial ties act to support OI in firms thus giving the insight that managers should be appreciated to build ties with managers of other firms, universities and government officials. Doing so can help firms achieve better OI outcomes. Firms should arrange means of interaction of their managers with these external knowledge sources such as events and occasions where managers of different firms can interact with each other to foster strong ties among them.

328,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to empirically investigate firms’ motives to patent in general, and more specifically how some of these motives depend upon firms’ technology strategies and especially their level of Open Innovation. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on a questionnaire survey sent to chief technology officers (or equivalent) of the largest R&D spenders among Swedish large firms (e.g. ABB, AstraZeneca, Ericsson, and Volvo) and among Swedish small and medium-sized enterprises. Principal component analysis and multiple linear regressions were used to check the impact from Open Innovation upon the importance of 21 different motives to patent, with a specific focus on protection and bargaining related motives. Findings: The most important motive to patent is to protect product technologies, but protecting freedom to operate is almost as important, followed by a number of other motives. Increasing importance of Open Innovation in firms is related to stronger bargaining motives to patent, and even stronger protection motives. In fact, when comparing with closed innovation, the results show that Open Innovation is more strongly positively related with all different motives to patent except for one (to attract customers). This indicates that firms find it more important to patent when engaged in Open Innovation than when engaged in closed innovation. Originality/value: The paper reports results from the first study that links patenting motives to technology strategies. It contributes to an emerging stream of empirical studies investigating the role of patents in external technology strategies and Open Innovation, showing that the motives to patent are strengthened within Open Innovation settings.

329,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how communication practices influence individuals’ team assembly and performance in Open Innovation contests. Design/methodology/approach: This study analyzed behavioral trace data of 4,651 teams and 19,317 participants from a leading Open Innovation platform, Kaggle. The analyses applied weighted least squares regression and weighted mediation analysis. Findings: Sharing online profiles positively relates to a person’s performance and likelihood of becoming a leader in Open Innovation teams. Team assembly effectiveness (one’s ability to team up with high-performing teammates) mediates the relationship between online profile sharing and performance. Moreover, sharing personal websites has a stronger positive effect on performance and likelihood of becoming a team leader, compared to sharing links to professional social networking sites (e.g. LinkedIn). Research limitations/implications: As team collaboration becomes increasingly common in Open Innovation, participants’ sharing of their online profiles becomes an important variable predicting their success. This study extends prior research on virtual team collaboration by highlighting the role of communication practices that occur in the team pre-assembly stage, as an antecedent of team assembly. It also addresses a long-standing debate about the credibility of information online by showing that a narrative-based online profile format (e.g. a personal website) can be more powerful than a standardized format (e.g. LinkedIn). Practical implications: Open Innovation organizers should encourage online profile sharing among participants to facilitate effective team assembly in order to improve innovation outcomes. Originality/value: The current study highlights the importance of team assembly in Open Innovation, especially the role of sharing online profiles in this process. It connects two areas of research that are previously distant, one on team assembly and one on online profile sharing.

330,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how knowledge search (KS) affects Open Innovation performance (OIP) in consideration of appropriability hazard in an emerging market context. Design/methodology/approach: The authors identify two types of appropriability hazard related to KS activities in the improvement of OIP: partner-related and market-related hazards, and construct a model of KS to the OIP with the government-enterprise relationship and market focus (MF) as moderating factors of the analysis framework, using the hierarchical regression analysis based on a survey sample of 258 Chinese companies. Findings: The authors find that KS has a stronger positive relationship with OIP in international market-focused enterprises compared with domestic market-focused enterprises. In addition, using a configuration approach, the authors find that KS is more positively related to OIP when enterprises have an international MF and a good relationship with the government, but less in other MF government and enterprises relationship configurations. Originality/value: This paper contributes to previous research work by identifying two types of appropriability hazard related to KS activities in emerging market countries: partner-related and market-related hazards. The authors argue that a positive relationship between KS and OIP is more likely to occur if these appropriability hazards can be mitigated by export MF and a good relationship with the government which has not been demonstrated in previous research.

Design/methodology/approach: The study reports the results of mediation analyses conducted on the basis of survey data from 307 firms. Findings: The economic benefits of both inbound and outbound OI are fully captured only if firms provide employees with time, freedom and independence. The results show that employee autonomy fully mediates the relationship between openness and innovation sales, while the adoption of inbound OI is positively associated with the introduction of new products. Practical implications: The opening of innovation induces managers to provide employees with discretion, as OI requires high levels of flexibility and experimentation.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper conducts a regression analysis by using a novel panel data set comprising of 438 innovative Chinese firms over the period of 2008-2011. Findings: The authors show that although on average openness to external actors improves innovation performance this effect is pronounced for EMEs that operate in subnational regions with a higher level of intellectual property rights (IPR) enforcement and of factor market development. The findings point to the context-dependent nature of OI strategy and the complementary effect of institutional parameters in emerging markets and help to reconcile the contrasting findings regarding the effect of OI in the prior literature. Originality/value: This paper extends the literature on OI by suggesting that the analysis of the performance consequences of OI strategy should go beyond the nexus between OI and firm performance, and instead, focus on subnational-specific institutions, such as region-specific IPR enforcement, factor market development and intermediation market development, that may facilitate or constrain the effect of OI model.

335,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between the use of Open Innovation practices and firm performance, and the role of organizational mechanisms (OMs) (formalization and decentralization) as moderator variables. Design/methodology/approach: The authors build a theoretical framework to define a set of hypotheses that are then verified in an empirical study. These theoretical propositions are tested by using the data gathered from a survey addressed to 244 firms in Spanish low- and medium-technology industries. Findings: With regard to inbound practices, the practices oriented to cooperate with partners in a R&D context have a positive influence. The results show that outbound practices, either by direct generation of revenues from licensing payments or, more indirectly, through the indirect marketing and technical benefits that can stem from revealing have a positive effect on firm performance. Coupled practices, which are related to participation in clusters and innovation networks, have the highest impact on firm performance. In the industrial context examined, decentralization exerts a positive effect which enhances the effect of outbound practices meanwhile formalization reduces their positive effect. Practical implications: This study helps practitioners in low- and medium-technology firms to determine which OI practices are most beneficial to firm performance and how formalization and decentralization can influence the relationship between OI and firm performance.

Design/methodology/approach: Survey data from 48 specialized SMEs manufacturing supercars were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. SmartPLS software was used to conduct a path analysis and test the proposed framework. Findings: The findings suggest that high adoption of OI models tends to increase firm innovativeness. Similarly, the adoption of OI practices has a positive effect on innovativeness but to a lesser extent than OI models. The moderation results of innovativeness further show that OI models and practices can benefit the performance of SMEs. Specifically, two dimensions of performance – environmental and social performance – were found to be greatly influenced by OI.

Design/methodology/approach: The focus of the study is on firms that received external help to develop their products or that helped third parties in developing their products. The hypotheses were tested on a large panel of more than 7,000 firms using generalized estimating equations. Findings: The results show that Open Innovation adoption is positively related to technology complexity and market uncertainty while it is negatively related to market concentration. Larger firms are more likely to adopt Open Innovation strategies. Originality/value: The research makes an important contribution to the literature by examining on a large sample of firms the moderating effects of industry concentration, industry research and development intensity and the technology life cycle stage on the adoption of Open Innovation.

340,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore, through the use of a multidisciplinary lens, the policy context and the scope for improvements in university-based public programmes focused on improving innovation in small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Design/methodology/approach: The authors use the street-level bureaucracy (SLB), combined with the systems of innovation approach (SIA) and diagnostic analysis (DA) to understand the context components that impact on public programme services. The study is part of a research programme oriented to the diffusion of information systems in SMEs and which used original interview-based programme support case studies, interviews with regional policy managers, and documentation relating to the policy system and different public programmes. Although the empirical work was UK and European Union centric the results of the research have wide applicability. Findings: The paper establishes the importance of programme contexts for diagnosing and providing a basis for public programme improvements. It further demonstrates the robustness of the context analysis framework to provide insights into proposed policy changes. The responsibility of improving programme contexts relies on actors that operate outside programme organisations, for instance EU funding bodies, government departments in charge of SME policies, public-private partnerships, and private evaluators. Given this complexity it is suggested that SME associations have a potentially important role in increasing participation by SMEs in the public programme for innovation and knowledge support policy. Despite possible policy changes the requirement for public programme support for innovation and hence the role of universities as programme providers is confirmed and expanded. Research limitations/implications: The results demonstrate the value of a multidisciplinary framework to analyse programme interventions at both macro and micro levels and provide a basis for programme policy and policy implementation improvements. Originality/value: This research is a novel attempt to use the SLB, SIA and DA to public programme university-based interventions in SMEs and SME policies in general. It complements extant research on Open Innovation and knowledge exchange by extending the concept of public programme contexts. Beneficiaries of the findings include policy makers, programme organisations, universities, SME associations, and researchers. ",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.057,-0.09,-0.052,-0.008,-0.001,-0.055
341,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to extend the knowledge into the relationship between Open Innovation and firm’s innovative performance. Specifically, the authors aim to determine whether the benefits of OI practices are different for Food and Beverage (FnB) firms as compared to those of other sectors. The FnB industry is relevant in terms of employment GDP generation in the UE, characterised by high integration and low-tech intensity. Design/methodology/approach: In order to achieve the goal and obtain robust results, the authors consider four OI dimensions and four innovation performance measures using panel data (2004-2011) from 10,771 FnB and non-FnB firms using Tobit and Logit models by random effects. Findings: The authors test and confirm the presence of the classical inverted U-shape relationship between OI and firm innovative performance for FnB and non-FnB companies. However, the optimal number of external sources of knowledge used is lesser for FnB than the rest of the companies. Originality/value: The paper compares the OI effects in a traditional and low-tech industry vs other industries considering four innovation outputs (product innovations, process innovations, incremental innovation and radical innovation).

342,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to fill a significant research gap in academic literature pertaining to Open Innovation. To do so, this paper empirically tests the impact of organizational culture, employees’ knowledge, attitudes and rewards as antecedents and mediators of OI adoption in organizations, facilitating a more thorough understanding by using an empirical multi-level approach. Design/methodology/approach: This paper analyzes the results of the “Identification of Industrial Needs for Open Innovation Education in Europe” survey through a quantitative analysis using logistic regression models. This survey includes 528 employees working in 28 different industrial sectors in 37 countries, most of which are in Europe. Findings: The results suggest a positive impact of organizational characteristics on the adoption of OI (i.e. including the adoption of outside-in and inside-out OI activities in participating organizations), showing that the openness of an organization’s culture increases its likelihood of adopting an OI paradigm. More importantly, the results highlight the positive mediating effect of employees’ knowledge and rewards on this relationship. Research limitations/implications: The data set that was the basis of this paper was generated in European countries, the results of the analysis are limited and appropriate for this region and may vary when applied to other regions of the world. Practical implications: The proposed multi-level approach offers new insight into organizational knowledge. It enables the improvement of OI and knowledge management practices in organizations by assisting practitioners and academics in recognizing the relationship between organizational culture; employees’ knowledge, attitudes and rewards; and the adoption of the OI paradigm. Social implications: This paper offers a possible explanation on why open-border cultures are more likely to have a successful OI adoption, by relating it to factors that advance in the presence of an open-border culture, such as active participation of OI relative departments in knowledge sourcing and knowledge exchange, and rewarding employees for OI activities. Originality/value: This paper presents a new framework which links organizational culture to OI, moving on from merely examining culture in terms of its positive or negative impact on OI adoption. It contributes to research on the OI paradigm and knowledge management by highlighting the significance of antecedents and mediators from a multi-level perspective using multiple units of analysis. Most previous studies focus on a single unit of analysis. ",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.097,-0.128,0.146,0.124,0.017,0.032
343,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to highlight the main Intellectual Property (IP) protection strategies adopted in the R&D phases of a company operating in the bio-pharmaceutical industry, according to an Open Innovation approach. Design/methodology/approach: In order to assess how R&D intensive firms adopt IP strategies during OI practices, this research uses a single case-study design. The case has been studied over an extended period of time (from 2008 to 2015), triangulating data and information by means of multiple interviews with different key informants and projects documents. The novelty of the research justifies the use of a single case study. Findings: The study reveals how a mix of formal and informal tools for IP protection are used, with a final attempt to maintain control over different technological solutions during their validation process and profiting from stable R&D collaborations with research partners. Research limitations/implications: Limitations of the study relate to the single case study methodology as well as to some peculiarities of the analyzed company and of the Bio-Pharmaceutical industry. Practical implications: Research managers could find some food for thought in the adoption of OI approaches for reducing costs and risks associated with technological uncertainty, with particular attention to the strategic role of IP rights. Originality/value: Despite knowledge protection being widely recognized to be a critical issue for implementing OI approaches, how IP strategies should be used in the different phases of R&D is still debatable. Moreover, few empirical studies relate to the adoption of optimal combinations of IP tools in relation to the different R&D phases in such technology intensive industries as the bio-pharmaceutical industry.

344,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of human dimensions, team climates, and technological features on Global Virtual Team (GVT) performance in the Malaysian Global Business Services (GBS) industry. Attention has also been paid to examine the moderating effect of team diversity and the extent of virtuality on GVT performance. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected using structured questionnaire and tested using partial least square – structural equation modelling. The authors collected 263 sample and the assessment of reflective measurement models, structural model, reliability and validity were conducted subsequently. Findings: This paper found that team climates like team cohesion, team confidence, and team knowledge, skills, and abilities demonstrated different impact on the human dimensions which include trust and creativity. It will then subsequently affect GVTs’ performance. Besides, team diversity which comprised of three major components that include age diversity, functional diversity, and attitudes/values diversity was found to moderate the relationships between the antecedents and consequent. In spite of that, the extent of virtuality was found to have no moderating effects on the relationships between the team creativity and trust and perceived team performance. Originality/value: As nowadays an increasing number of firms are becoming global, inquiring into GVTs efficient management is of crucial importance for successful implementation of Open Innovation practices, while GBS companies could represent the most suitable setting to examine the GVT’s underlying principles. This paper integrates adaptive structuration theory with input-mediator-output-input model to provide a holistic study on GVTs’ performance. In addition, this study also illustrated how the extent of virtually can be measured quantitatively. ",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.047,-0.008,0.0,-0.032,-0.107,-0.013
345,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relational dynamics for innovation and, in particular, the impact of the openness of innovation process on the innovation capacity of organisations in restricted geographical contexts. Design/methodology/approach: Through a negative binomial regression, the work analyses how the characteristics of the openness of the organisation’s innovation process in the period 2004-2010 influence the firm’s patent productivity in the following period (2011-2016). Findings: The breadth of the Open Innovation process, here measured by the number of external network ties that an organisation realises for the realisation of its patents, has a positive effect on patent productivity. The depth of the openness, that is, the intensity of external network ties, has an equally positive influence on the innovative performance. However, after a tipping point, the patent productivity tends to decrease, underlining the costs and problems of OI practices. Research limitations/implications: This study considers only patent collaborations in the city of Florence. Therefore, it focusses on codified innovations and on a single territorial case study. Practical implications: The results underline the importance of the adoption of OI practices in restricted geographical contexts (such as cities, clusters or industrial districts) but with several limitations. Only collaborating more with others does not foster the organisation’s invention productivity, but different types of evidence are found here. Originality/value: An original database has been created, containing all the information on patents realised in the area of Florence from 2004 until 2016, and a social networks analysis was applied to identify the local innovation networks.

346,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the way companies involved in Open Innovation Processes (OIPs) routinize the procedure through which they can absorb in-bound knowledge, i.e. knowledge that comes from the outside and, in particular, from the crowd. In-bound knowledge passes through the phases of acquisition, assimilation, transformation and exploitation. Thus, companies need to define mechanisms and paths – related to their potential and realized absorptive capacity –to manage and exploit it. Design/methodology/approach: The present paper is based on a longitudinal case study, an OIP launched by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) that has already been implemented for three times. Multiple direct interviews with FCA top managers have allowed rebuilding the routinized procedure through which the company absorbs in-bound knowledge. Findings: To routinize the procedure of absorbing in-bound knowledge, the company has settled specific mechanisms and paths and has established some bottlenecks over the process of acquisition, assimilation, transformation and exploitation of in-bound knowledge. These mechanisms and path, as well as these bottlenecks, are identified and descripted in the paper. Research limitations/implications: Beyond the limitations linked to the use of a single case study, another limitation might be the reference to a big company in a specific industry. Anyway, with due caution, achieved findings can be referred to other industries as well. Originality/value: This paper contributes to exploring if and how companies managing OIPs routinize the procedure through which they can absorb in-bound knowledge.

347,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to link crowdsourcing, operations management (OM) and project management (PM). The study demonstrates how crowdsourcing as an Open Innovation mechanism is operationalised within a complex PM context. Specifically, the study seeks to understand how crowdsourcing as a novel form of OM improves key outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted exploratory research involving five pure-play crowdsourcing firms based in the USA and Australia. Findings: The findings indicate that the firms practise a form of crowdsourcing that allows flexible, efficient and low risk operations and links to contemporary notions of PM such as projectification and project society. The crowd can be used in a new manner to boost success factors tied to PM through Open Innovation and operational novelty. In terms of OM, crowdsourcing offers flexibility, speed, dynamism and scalability to project processes. Research limitations/implications: This research is based on five case studies. Further fine-grained, longitudinal research is required to fully understand this phenomenon in a wider range of contexts. Practical implications: The paper contributes to practices tied to Open Innovation and provides guidance on how organisations might use large crowds to enhance PM success. Originality/value: The study represents early scholarship on crowdsourcing and project operations. It makes three contributions. First, the authors introduce a new theoretical framework linking PM and novel aspects of crowdsourcing to extend understandings of projectification, as well as Open Innovation frameworks. Second, the authors showcase the flexibility and fluidity of the crowdsourcing project process. Third, the authors examine crowdsourcing operations in terms of size, efficiency and scalability which results in timely and efficient output due to innovative technology, along with the element of trust among stakeholders.

348,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide a patent-based framework for investigating the effect of previous and current Open Innovation adoption on firms’ knowledge management strategies and type of innovation output. Design/methodology/approach: Patent data are employed for gauging innovation practices, exploitation vs exploration strategies, specialization vs diversification choices and type of innovation. The study is performed on a sample of 1,280 patents granted to 66 top R&D spending bio-pharmaceutical companies. The year of analysis is 2010. Findings: The previous recourse to specific innovation practices influences the current practice selection. R&D collaboration, outsourcing and mergers and acquisitions are employed to pursue exploration. Past purchase of patents increases the likelihood to achieve architectural and radical innovation in current activities. Research limitations/implications: The work recommends the use of patent data to gauge many key elements for knowledge and innovation management. Results exhort scholars to investigate innovation practices at the knowledge domain level in order to detect specific behaviors. Practical implications: The study provides a methodology for supporting decision-makers in assessing firms’ OI adoption, also performing the benchmark with competitors and R&D partners. Given the high computational effort required for applying the methodology, the authors are planning to give access to the software specifically developed for this study.

Findings: The study derives a model that explains the most relevant factors behind the innovation processes developed by young entrepreneurs in family firms: network membership benefits; KF; track record of innovation; and the entrepreneurial attitude of employees. Research limitations/implications: By integrating insights from different research streams, namely, innovation management, Open Innovation and family firms, the study provides a novel contribution to the Open Innovation process in family firms.

351,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to study how the online temporary crowd shares knowledge in a way that fosters the integration of their diverse knowledge. Having the crowd integrate its knowledge to offer solution-ideas to ill-structured problems posed by organizations is one of the desired outcomes of crowd-based Open Innovation because, by integrating others’ knowledge, the ideas are more likely to consider the many divergent issues related to solving the ill-structured problem. Unfortunately, the diversity of knowledge content offered by heterogeneous specialists in the online temporary crowd makes integration difficult, and the lean social context of the crowd makes extensive dialogue to resolve integration issues impractical. The authors address this issue by exploring theoretically how the manner in which interaction is organically conducted during Open Innovation challenges enables the generation of integrative ideas. The authors hypothesize that, as online crowds organically share knowledge based upon successful pro-socially motivated interaction, they become more productive in generating integrative ideas. Design/methodology/approach: Using a multilevel mixed-effects model, this paper analyzed 2,244 posts embedded in 747 threads with 214 integrative ideas taken from 10 Open Innovation challenges. Findings: Integrative ideas were more likely to occur after pro-socially motivated interactions. Research limitations/implications: Ideas that integrate knowledge about the variety of issues that relate to solving an ill-structured problem are desired outcomes of crowd-based Open Innovation challenges. Given that members of the crowd in Open Innovation challenges rarely engage in dialogue, a new theory is needed to explain why integrative ideas emerge at all. The authors’ adaptation of pro-social motivation interaction theory helps to provide such a theoretical explanation. Practitioners of crowd-based Open Innovation should endeavor to implement systems that encourage the crowd members to maintain a high level of activeness in pro-socially motivated interaction to ensure that their knowledge is integrated as solutions are generated. Originality/value: The present study extends the crowd-based Open Innovation literature by identifying new forms of social interaction that foster more integrated ideas from the crowd, suggesting the mitigating role of pro-socially motivated interaction in the negative relationship between knowledge diversity and knowledge integration. This study fills in the research gap in knowledge management research describing a need for conceptual frameworks explaining how to manage the increasing complexity of knowledge in the context of crowd-based collaboration for innovation.

352,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to study the external sources of knowledge that better exploit internal knowledge in order to innovate. Design/methodology/approach: A balanced panel of 1,266 firms that respond to the Survey of Business Strategies for a five-year period was used, which represents a total of 6,330 observations. Findings: The influence of the absorptive capacity on new products is significant, with an inverted U-shaped relationship. The interaction between external sources of knowledge and firm's absorptive capacity has a negative effect on innovation up to a certain level (substitution effect), after which that interaction improves the innovation of firms, displaying a complementary effect. Practical implications: Firms with excess of internal sources of knowledge do not obtain better innovative results because overtime firms tend to inertia and need external sources of knowledge to obtain new knowledge. Firms must be conscious that the effect on innovation of using a strategy of external knowledge acquisition could be different depending on their internal knowledge base level. Thus, those firms that select their strategies to combine knowledge appropriately will have better results. Originality/value: This paper reveals that the positive effect of internal sources of knowledge on innovation decline after it reaches a high level because those firms with strong absorptive capacity may enter a state of organizational inertia that reduces their innovation. This research enhances the importance of identifying each of the external knowledge sources likely to be used, since their influence on innovation differs depending on the level of internal knowledge. Finally, this study is based on panel data models, which allows us to control unobservable heterogeneity improving earlier studies that had to rely on cross-sectional data.

The authors consider patents, industrial designs (i.e. design patents in the USA), trademarks, and s. Design/methodology/approach: The relationships between Open Innovation, IPRs, and profitability are tested with random-effects panel regressions on data from the Spanish Community Innovation Survey for 2,873 firms spanning the years 2008-2013. Findings: A key result is that SMEs do not benefit from Open Innovation or from patenting in the same way as larger firms. Furthermore, the results show that SMEs profit in different ways from IPR, depending on their size and the corresponding IPR. Research limitations/implications: The different impact of IPRs on the efficiency of Open Innovation in firms of varying sizes highlights the importance of further investigation into IP strategies and into Open Innovation in SMEs. Practical implications: Industrial designs are currently the most efficient IPR for SMEs to protect their intellectual property in Open Innovation collaborations. Depending on the company size, the use of different IPRs is recommended. Moreover, firms should seek to increase the efficiency of Open Innovation and the use of IPRs. Social implications: The high impact of SMEs on employment highlights the importance of fomenting efficient innovation processes in such firms.

This adds to the understanding of the particular patterns of Open Innovation and what characterizes the innovation emerging through this approach. Design/methodology/approach: Tests are performed on the effect of internal and external collaboration on the degree of newness (incremental/radical) in innovation projects. This adds to the understanding of the particular patterns of OI and what characterizes the innovation emerging through this approach. The empirical analysis is based on a data set including responses from 512 Danish engineers. Findings: The results show that external collaboration has significantly different effects on the degree of newness depending on the type of external partners involved, and they also show that radical innovation output is positively related to involving the R&D department (internal) and universities (external involvement) and negatively related to involving suppliers. Originality/value: The results provide a more detailed understanding of how different OI patterns affect the development of incremental vs radical innovation in existing organizations. In particular, three findings add new insights into how OI affects innovation to reach the highest degree of newness: high importance of collaboration with external partners with distinct interests and skills; low reliance on existing customers and suppliers for the development of radical innovation; and narrow and focused internal involvement rather than broad internal involvement.

Specifically, it intends to investigate the contribution of OIDPs-oriented to successfully implement all the phases of interactive coupled OI processes. Design/methodology/approach: The paper carries out an exploratory qualitative analysis, adopting the single case study method. The case here investigated is Open Innovation Platform Regione Lombardia (OIPRL). Findings: The case study sheds light on how OIPRL supports knowledge co-creation through its processes, tools and services as a co-creator intermediary. In its launch stage, the platform simply aimed at giving firms a tool to “find partners” and financial resources to achieve innovative projects. Now, however, the platform has developed into an engagement platform for knowledge co-creation. Research limitations/implications: One limitation lies in the particular perspective used to perform the case study: the perspective of the digital platform itself. Future research should focus on the individuals engaged in the platform to better investigate the processes, tools and services used to implement the OI approach.

One of the OI practices used by the public research centers to market their technologies is to set up new business entities called RBSOs. Many studies have focused on spin-offs but there are still some gaps. To overcome the existing limitations, the authors built a framework which they tested on three previous case studies.

Design/methodology/approach: Using a framework based on the role of the government in Open Innovation, this study analyses a profile of early Open Innovation adopters based on collected data from secondary sources. Findings: First, the USA, Australia and Singapore developed Open Innovation policies at the national level, facilitating a positive innovation climate. Many projects, especially those in online platforms, were established under these policies. Second, although outside-in Open Innovation principles seem to be popular, there have been emerging attempts to exploit the value of government data through inside-out approaches. Research limitations/implications: Most governments are in the early stages of adoption of Open Innovation and are in the process of understanding relevant issues. Future research should investigate how governments adopt Open Innovation, in particular inside-out initiatives. Practical implications: Governments should develop an overarching strategic plan, which would help its employees to recognise that new change is consistent with the needs of their workplace practices.

358,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore organizational factors that act as antecedents of Open Innovation search. The authors aim to empirically examine whether the extent to which the organizational slack is absorbed determines its influence on firms’ openness in innovation search. In addition, the authors also examine the moderating effect of absorptive capacity on the relationship between slack and Open Innovation search. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted secondary data from multiple sources (NBER, Compustat and US census) and then constructed a ten-year balanced panel dataset of 298 manufacturers. The generalized least square method was used to explore the determinants of Open Innovation search among manufacturing firms. Findings: The results of this study reveal that the absorption level of organizational slack indeed determines the openness in innovation search. Specifically, absorbed slack negatively affects a firm’s openness in innovation search, whereas unabsorbed slack promotes Open Innovation search. Additionally, the relationship between absorbed slack and Open Innovation search will be less negative with the increase of absorptive capacity. Originality/value: Different from most previous studies that have examined the performance effect of open search among high-tech and large enterprises, this study focuses on the antecedents of open search strategy in both high- and low-tech, large and small firms. The findings reveal that different forms of organizational slack divergently influence a firm’s open search strategy, contributing to the understanding of the relationship between organizational slack and knowledge search behavior in a broader context, as well as the understanding of the moderating effect of absorptive capacity.

359,"Purpose: The rising need to innovate and obtain knowledge from more distant knowledge sources calls for new innovation strategies and a better integration of other external actors who lie outside the traditional automotive supply chain. Such an Open Innovation strategy challenges organizational boundaries both on the firm and supply chain level, yet our understanding of the functioning of such boundaries and how they can be managed to allow for purposive knowledge flows is limited. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: In a longitudinal case study, the authors trace the development of the first Open Innovation network in the German automotive industry over a period of five years based on archival data, semi-structured interviews, and field observations. Findings: While the automotive industry is advanced in collaborating with suppliers for innovation, routines for assessing and integrating ideas from sources outside the supply chain are still underdeveloped. The authors show which current knowledge boundaries pose obstacles for Open Innovation initiatives in this industry, and how they could be mediated through the involvement of gatekeepers.

361,"Purpose: This paper aims to explore how community-controlled Open Innovation affects cost- and differentiation-based competitive advantage, and to explain how it allows some sources of economic rent to remain while others are taken away. Although models of competitive-advantage remain relevant, Open Innovation means that the main drivers of performance are changed. Open Innovation means that there are implications for firms' ability to profit from intellectual property that they do not own. The paper seeks to address those issues. Design/methodology/approach: The work is conceptual. Findings: Economic rents from property rights disappear, those from economies of scale and capital requirements are reduced, but those from experience-curve effects, differentiation, distribution, and switching costs remain. Similarly, rents from the difficult-to-imitate resources of networks and reputation remain intact, and while those from employee knowhow and culture remain, they are likely to be in reduced amounts. Research limitations/implications: Propositions are provided for empirical testing. There also is a need to identify breakpoints between open-innovation benefits and the costs associated with lost innovation skills, and a need to extend this work to firm-controlled and third-party controlled Open Innovation. Practical implications: For some firms Open Innovation will not adversely affect competitive advantage but those whose advantage is driven by barriers to entry, skills in innovation and anticipating customer needs, or that rely on proprietary product designs, can lose in the longer term. Originality/value: Where the majority of work examining Open Innovation addresses property rights, economic rationales, governance, and processes, this work focuses on the effects of Open Innovation on strategy content and consequent firm performance.

362,"Purpose: This paper aims to focus on the human side of inbound Open Innovation by analyzing the effects that the adoption of different knowledge search strategies for innovation has on new recruitment needs. Design/methodology/approach: Building on several theoretical perspectives, the study proposes three hypotheses regarding the relationship between openness and the need to recruit people with high technical and social skills. Using a pooled panel data from the Uruguayan Innovation Survey between 2004 and 2012, the authors identify open strategies followed by the firm. Findings: The estimation results using pooled panel data confirm that the adoption of inbound open search strategies for innovation demands the recruitment of new employees with higher technical and social skills. Technical skills are more likely to be demanded than social skills. The effects observed are moderated by the intensity in the use of knowledge and information sources (KISs). Originality/value: This paper revisits the analysis of specific knowledge search strategies at the firm level. In doing so, the study looks for the effects of specific strategies combining different knowledge sources and considers different levels of use of external KISs, from narrow to wide. While other studies have analyzed the human factor as a determinant of the success of openness for innovation, this paper re-examines the direction of this relationship. Finally, the study contributes to the evidence from a Latin American country, where these topics have received less attention. ",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.058,0.008,-0.02,0.042,-0.032,-0.011
363,"Purpose: This paper aims to identify the prominent themes of Open Innovation for sustainability (OIS) and establish their inter-relationships. Moreover, it examines the importance of success factors (i.e. knowledge management system, openness and organizational structure) and their configuration for co-creating shared value for OIS in manufacturing micro small and medium enterprises. Design/methodology/approach: The first stage of investigation determines the relationship between concepts using the bibliometric technique. The second stage examines predictors (e.g. knowledge management system, openness and organizational structure) that contribute to the desired outcomes (creation of shared value in OIS) through necessary condition analysis. Findings: The investigation demonstrates that all three conditions are necessary for (at different levels) creating shared values for OIS. More specifically, the investigation shows that the different levels of creation of shared value outcomes do require organizations to configure organizational interventions at different levels of the knowledge management system, openness and organizational structure. Practical implications: To use the concept of Open Innovation, organizations need to expand their view beyond their existing resource pool and business environment, to include their partners and stakeholders for more inclusivity. Such creation of shared value for OI does require active participation, interaction and collaboration with both manufacturer, retailers and other stakeholders, for developing an insight in creating value for sustainability problem-solving context. Originality/value: The investigation advances the existing body of knowledge that propagates the significance of knowledge management system, openness and organizational structure as the antecedent to increase the creation of shared value for sustainability by organizations.

364,"Purpose: This paper aims to investigate three key factors (i.e. cognitive dimensions, the knowledge-driven approach and absorptive capacity) that are likely to determine the preference for informal inbound Open Innovation modes, through the lens of the OI model and knowledge-based view (KBV). The innovation literature has differentiated these collaborations into informal inbound OI entry modes and formal inbound OI modes, offering an advocative and conceptual view. However, empirical studies on these collaborations are still limited. Design/methodology/approach: Building on the above-mentioned theoretical framework, the empirical research was performed in two stages. First, data were collected via a closed-ended questionnaire distributed to all the participants from the sample by e-mail. Second, to assess the hypotheses, structural equation modelling (SEM) via IBM® SPSS® Amos 20 was applied. Findings: The empirical research was conducted on 175 small to medium enterprises in the United Kingdom, suggesting that the knowledge-driven approach is the strongest determinant, leading to a preference for informal inbound OI modes. The findings were obtained using SEM and are discussed in line with the theoretical framework. Research limitations/implications: Owing to the chosen context and sector of the empirical analysis, the research results may lack generalisability. Hence, new studies are proposed. Practical implications: The paper includes implications for the development of informal inbound OI led by knowledge-driven approach. Originality/value: This paper offers an empirical research to investigate knowledge-driven preferences in informal inbound OI modes.

366,"Purpose: This paper aims to shed light on how family firms execute Open Innovation strategies by managing internal and external knowledge flows. Design/methodology/approach: First, through a comprehensive literature review, the paper identifies the barriers to the acquisition and transfer of knowledge in Open Innovation processes. Second, it presents and discusses the results of an exploratory case study on Loccioni, an Italian family firm providing high-tech measurement solutions, highlighting how this family firm managed to overcome the barriers in executing an Open Innovation strategy. Findings: The case study shows that Loccioni faced specific challenges in acquiring and transferring knowledge in its Open Innovation processes and developed two idiosyncratic capabilities – labelled imprinting and fraternization – that helped the firm overcome the barriers to knowledge acquisition and transfer. The analysis shows that these two capabilities are enabled by the distinctive goals and social capital characterizing family firms.

367,"Purpose: This paper aims to stimulate debate among academic and policymaking communities as to understanding the importance of social processes and Open Innovation contexts within existing models of knowledge transfer and exchange (KTE) between higher education institutions (HEIs) and industry. Design/methodology/approach: This research was conducted through a number of case studies connected to UK HEIs and through extensive interviews with representatives of HEI, industry and policy makers over a two-year period. Findings: The results confirm that social processes are often under-explored in collaborative HEI-industry settings. The study identified seven emerging themes which are important to HEI-industry relationships: the importance of network intermediaries; flexibility, openness and connectivity of network structures; encouraging network participation; building trust in relationships through mutual understanding; active network learning; strengthening cooperation through capacity building; and culture change. Practical implications: This research raises implications for policymakers and practitioners engaged in developing KTE collaborative activities. The paper argues for greater attention to be placed upon the social processes that affect collaborative innovation and working. Policymaking in particular needs to take account of these processes as they are neither easy to establish nor sustain. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the literature on HEI-industry interactions for enhanced KTE activity and partnership working which demonstrates value to wider scholarly and practitioner readership.

368,"Purpose: This paper aims to study the impact of Chief Executive Officer's (CEO's) personality traits on Open Innovation strategies and the mediating effect of innovation climate by mobilizing the upper echelons theory and the OI literature. In fact, CEO's role in OI promotion has been under-investigated in the literature especially in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and in developing economies. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the structural equation modeling, a survey is scheduled by administrating a questionnaire within 178 CEOs in Tunisian high-tech sector. The relevance of the empirical evidences is to disclose human levers to the success of OI strategies in the Tunisian context as a developing country. Findings: The results show the importance of CEO's entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and attitude in promoting innovation climate and so then OI strategies. The study offers a reading grid for managers of high-tech SMEs to better lead and identify key factors for OI adoption. Innovative climate is found to be a relevant driver of OI encompassing the key role of attitude and EO of top managers. Practical implications: Results highlight the relevance of the recruitment of appropriate top managers with high levels of EO and with positive attitude toward OI in order to facilitate OI integration and to enhance SMEs' competitiveness. Entrepreneurially oriented CEOs should be required in order to overcome ""Not Invented Here"" and ""Not Shared Here"" syndromes, to support innovative climate and to encourage knowledge import and export in the Tunisian SMEs. Originality/value: This paper sheds light on the micro-foundation of OI by emphasizing the relevance of human factors and namely EO and attitude of CEOs in OI issue. It provides conceptual and empirical clarification of the extent to which CEO's traits affect OI through innovative climate.

369,"Purpose: This paper aims to visualize the communication processes between stakeholders who discuss, reach consensus and engage with user-generated ideas through an Open Innovation platform facilitated by Destination Management Organization (DMO). Design/methodology/approach: Various discussion and interaction styles between the different types of stakeholders on the innovation platform are analyzed using quantitative content analysis. Likewise, perceived issues among the stakeholders that motivate collaboration and consensus are identified. Findings: This paper identifies that stakeholders interact with each other, reach agreements and solve joint problems on the platform by using predominantly constructive interaction styles. Meanwhile, feasibility and strategic issues appear to be the most dominant topics when discussing the fruition of ideas; however, this depends significantly on the category of the idea. Practical implications: DMOs are given an understanding of why and how stakeholders engage with a certain idea and the kind of challenges they perceive when pursuing the execution of an idea. DMOs are advised to carefully design an Open Innovation platform to facilitate effective online discussions that may lead to working groups.

372,"Purpose: This paper explores openness within new product development (NPD) projects. The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of breadth, depth and partner newness on product innovativeness and product competitive advantage. The authors also seek to examine the contingent effects of the appropriability regime. The authors make suggestions to academics and practitioners based on the findings. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use a structured survey instrument producing an empirical analysis of 205 NPD projects in the manufacturing sector in the UK. The authors use an ordinary least squares regression model to test hypothesised relationships between openness (breadth, depth and partner newness), product innovativeness, product competitive advantage and the appropriability regime. Findings: The authors find that each of the three dimensions of openness, depth, breadth and partner newness, have a significant but differing impact on product innovativeness. Specifically, the study indicates that breadth has a positive effect but only in the presence of a strong appropriability regime, partner newness has a direct positive effect, and depth a direct negative effect. The authors also find that product innovativeness has a positive impact on product competitive advantage. Research limitations/implications: Further research should focus on replicating the findings in other countries, search for further moderating factors, such as the stage of the NPD process, and analyse the longitudinal impact of openness within NPD projects. Practical implications: Organisations are encouraging managers to be more open in their approach to NPD. The authors’ findings suggest that managers need to think about the three dimensions of openness, breadth, depth and partner newness. Their engagement with each of these dimensions depends on the desired outcomes of the innovation project and the strength of patents. Originality/value: The research extends the extant supplier involvement in new product development literature to examine the effect of up to 11 types of external actor in NPD projects. The authors test a new multi-dimensional measurement scale for the openness construct. The authors show that each dimension has a different relationship with product innovativeness.

373,"Purpose: This paper seeks to explore how market orientation facilitates the strategic flexibility of business models grounded in Open Innovation. The authors suggest that the new paradigm of Open Innovation may impact a firm's adaptability and responsiveness under conditions of environmental flux. However, extending innovation capacity by opening the innovation process poses major challenges for firms. The aims of this study are to explore the characteristics of Open Innovation activity and to contemplate the role of strategic flexibility in the design of business models based upon Open Innovation. Design/methodology/approach: The study draws upon a qualitative research approach through a longitudinal case study in the field of open source software (OSS). The empirical case illustrates how an OSS firm utilizes signals in its environment to flexibly alter its business model. Findings: A business model that embodies Open Innovation raises dilemmas between open and closed innovation paradigms. However, the authors' case highlights that an ambidextrous approach that combines market orientation with the principles of Open Innovation increases profitability, shortens time to market through effective market access, and enhances innovation capability. Research limitations/implications: The results have profound implications for industrial marketers, managers, management consultants and business educators. They can use the insights gleaned from this research to guide the development of business models that involve Open Innovation. The results indicate that firms involved in Open Innovation need reactive strategic flexibility to cope with the environmental diversity and variability. However, this study analyzes a single case in the field of OSS and one should be cautious when generalizing the findings.

374,"Purpose: This research paper aims to examine how Open Innovation intermediaries facilitate knowledge collaboration between organizations and online user communities. Drawing on a Community of Practice (CoP) perspective on knowledge, the study lays out a framework of the knowledge boundary management mechanisms (and associated practices) that intermediaries deploy in enabling client organizations to engage in online community-based OI. Design/methodology/approach: This research is based on an exploratory case study of an OI intermediary and 18 client organizations that engage with online user communities on the intermediary’s platform. Results incorporate both the intermediary and clients’ perspective, based on analysis of intermediary and client interviews, clients’ online community projects and other archival data. Findings: Results reveal that OI intermediaries deploy three knowledge boundary management mechanisms – syntactic, semantic and pragmatic – each underpinned by a set of practices. Together, these mechanisms enable knowledge transfer, translation and transformation, respectively, and thus lead to cumulatively richer knowledge collaboration outcomes at the organization–community boundary. The findings show that the pragmatic mechanism reinforces both semantic and syntactic mechanisms, and is hence the most critical to achieving effective knowledge collaboration in community-based OI settings. Practical implications: The findings suggest that OI intermediaries have to implement all three boundary management mechanisms to successfully enable knowledge collaboration for community-based OI. More specifically, intermediaries need to expand their focus beyond the development of digital platforms, to include nuanced efforts at building organizational commitment to community engagement. Originality/value: Drawing on the CoP view, this study integrates the knowledge management literature into the OI literature to conceptualize the role of OI intermediaries in shaping knowledge collaboration between organizations and communities. In engaging with the interactive nature of knowledge exchange in such multi-actor settings, this research extends the firm-centric theorization of knowledge that currently dominates the existing OI research.

375,"Purpose: This research seeks to answer the basic question, ""As a city evolves from an industrial city to a knowledge one, are its Open Innovation activities vitalized?"" Design/methodology/approach: In this research, we compare the total number of patent applications, the number of joint applicants of each patent, and the ratio of patents jointly applied, in four Korean cities-Daegu, Kwangju, Cheonann total, top 10 % patent applicants group among total patent applicants, and the lower 70 % patent applicant group among total patent applicants. The research included 144,625 patents submitted to the Korea Patent Office from 1981 to 2010. Findings: As knowledge-based urbanization proceeds, the size of a knowledge city increases. The lowest 70 % of patent applicants (rather than the top 10 %) apply for more patents, and the breadth and depth of Open Innovation rises. Research limitations/implications (if applicable): This research is limited to mutual patent applications as a target of Open Innovation. In the future, additional research will need to be conducted on various Open Innovation channels such as patent citation, intellectual property right transfer, licensing, and M & A. Practical implications (if applicable): To maximize the beneficial characteristics of a knowledge city in a large city, the improvement of Open Innovation across the city is essential. Social implications (if applicable): If strengthening Open Innovation by SMEs or start-ups is set as a corporate strategy or a government policy, it will be a source of development of knowledge-based urbanization and continued economic development of a knowledge city, as well as of the total knowledge assets.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts hierarchical regressions to validate the theoretical model and collect the patent data of the top 54 firm patentees in the smartphone industry as empirical sample. Using patent citation network data, this paper estimates the relationship between Open Innovation, network embeddedness and incremental innovation capability. Findings: This paper empirically shows that structural embeddedness exerts a negative effect on incremental innovation capability, while relational embeddedness is positively related to incremental innovation capability. And Open Innovation strengthens the relationship between network embeddedness and incremental innovation capability. Originality/value: This paper shifts the focus of the determinants of incremental innovation capability from internal factors to the external network features by exploring the linkage between network embeddedness and incremental innovation capability. A counterintuitive conclusion is that structural embeddedness shows a negative effect on firm's incremental innovation capability. Furthermore, in contrast to most previous studies, which only focus on the direct effect of Open Innovation on the firm's incremental innovation capability, our study examines the moderating effect of Open Innovation on the relationships between network embeddedness and incremental innovation capability. At last, the results provide practical guidance for firms to occupy the beneficial network positions and adopt appropriate Open Innovation strategies to improve their incremental innovation capability.

377,"Purpose: This study aims to assess how firm functional capability moderates the relationship between two types of Open Innovation and performance, with a special focus on the role of technological capability and the join effect market information management capability. This paper develops and tests a research model, which assesses how the performance implications of two Open Innovation forms are shaped by the technological capability and how such an effect is contingent on market information management capability. Design/methodology/approach: Survey data were collected from 238 Chinese high-tech enterprises. Structural equation modeling and linear regression were used to test the data. Then, the main research questions were answered. Findings: Empirically results show that technological capability strengthens the influence of inbound Open Innovation on firm performance. However, the moderate effect of technological capability on the relationship between outbound Open Innovation and firm performance remains unsupported. A higher technological capability with a high level of market information management capability increases the efficacy of outbound Open Innovation in gaining superior performance. Additional analysis shows that when firms implement inbound activities and possess a strong technological capability, they will achieve higher performance if they possess a moderate level of market information management capability, compared with a high or low level. Originality/value: This paper provides new evidence on the benefits of different Open Innovation strategies on firm’s performance and, more importantly, the specific firm-level contingencies (technological capability and market information management capability) under which these benefits are more likely to be enhanced. It clarifies what the capabilities are and how they interact to foster the robust Open Innovation strategies, which sheds new light on the boundary conditions that affect the Open Innovations–firm performance relationship.

Drawing from the absorptive capacity perspective, organizational inertia theory, and Open Innovation, the authors seek to argue that dynamic innovation capabilities have a curvilinear effect on breakthrough innovation that is moderated by Open Innovation activities. Design/methodology/approach: A mail survey was sent to the top 1,000 firms in Taiwan, the target respondents being senior managers with experience in developing at least three successful breakthrough innovations in the past five years. A total of 218 usable questionnaires were collected, resulting in a respondent rate of 22.9 percent. Findings: The findings support the argument that dynamic innovation capabilities have an inverted U-shape relationship with breakthrough innovation. Meanwhile, Open Innovation activities strengthen the positive effects of dynamic innovation capabilities on breakthrough innovation. Research limitations/implications: The findings enrich the existing literature by proposing and confirming empirically that Open Innovation activities help firms with effective coordination of dynamic innovation capabilities.

Findings: HPWS positively impacts Open Innovation. IT exploration capability strengthens the relationship between HPWS and Open Innovation, whereas IT exploitation capability and ambidexterity do not strengthen such relationship. Research limitations/implications: Firms should use HPWS to improve employees' motivation of external learning and searching for enhancing innovation openness.

381,"Purpose: This study aims to use expectation disconfirmation theory (EDT) to investigate how an organization’s satisfaction with its supply network’s behavior influences its intention to Open Innovation with that network. This paper proposes that an organization’s orientation to Open Innovation is influenced by confirmation of previously held expectations of trust and commitment and level of perceived procedural justice in its Open Innovation partner. This paper also examines the effect of this orientation on the organization’s supply chain competence. Design/methodology/approach: Using data from a survey of 286 European firms, the study proposes and evaluates a structural equation model. Findings: The results show that a positive disconfirmation of trust (where perceived trust exceeds expectations) plays a crucial role in shaping organizations’ intentions to continue Open Innovation with their supply networks. These results show that disconfirmation is a good predictor of overall satisfaction with Open Innovation. This paper also confirms the positive effect of orientation to Open Innovation on supply chain competence. Finally, this paper obtained evidence for the positive effect of supply chain competence on firm performance. Originality/value: This study shows the importance of managing expectations in Open Innovation under the EDT. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no previous research has analyzed the consistency between the trust and commitment an organization expects from its Open Innovation partner and the trust and commitment it ultimately perceives as a factor explaining its degree of orientation to Open Innovation.

383,"R&D and innovation increasingly take place in networks that extend beyond the boundaries of a single firm, with customers in an important role in the learning processes involved. This phenomenon is captured by the term ""Open Innovation"". Advantages of Open Innovation encompass cost reduction and an increased competitiveness. Spatial innovation theory however indicates that the potential of Open Innovation is not the same for all urban regions, there may be differences between large metropolitan areas and small cities. In this context, the authors compare university spin-off firms in two contrasting urban regions in Europe, Delft in the Netherlands and Trondheim in Norway (a metropolitan area versus an isolated city) with regard to the profile of their learning networks and the contribution of these networks to growth. Learning networks appear to differ in structure and strength, in spatial configuration and also in the influence on job growth. Thus, networks in Delft (in a large metropolitan area) tend to be stronger compared to those in Trondheim (isolated city), whereas the influence of network strength on growth tends to be negative in Delft but positive in Trondheim. Overall, firms in Trondheim tend to rely more on own resources and capabilities and less on learning networks in Open Innovation.

384,"Recent literature on Open Innovation highlights the need for studies regarding the factors that influence firms to switch from a closed to an OI strategy. At the same time, stakeholder literature points out the scarcity of knowledge regarding antecedent factors fostering collaboration with the firm's stakeholders and their engagement for higher value creation. To fill these gaps, we propose an analytical framework for implementing a strategic OI process through the development of stakeholder engagement. Our framework comprises 17 factors grouped in five levers: knowledge, collaboration, organizational, strategic, and financial. We empirically applied this framework to two industrial SMEs. A qualitative study was conducted based on semi-structured interviews with internal and external stakeholders of both firms. The results show that one company successfully implemented the OI process, while the other struggled to evolve from a traditionally closed innovation model to a more open model. Analyzing the results, we identified several aspects that could explain this difference. These aspects concern the OI activities performed by both firms, the combination of the five levers into a coherent OI approach, stakeholder engagement, and the characteristics of the CEOs. The current study contributes insights for theory and practice, especially as it proposes an original framework for developing a strategic OI process that integrates a stakeholder approach.

385,"Recent studies suggest that the effectiveness of Open Innovation can significantly differ among firms. One possible reason is the different ways of implementing OI strategies. Another is the ignorance of the explicit role of business model (BM). In this study, we integrate the two plausible explanations by exploring the impact of the interplay between different OI implementations and BM on firms’ new product development (NPD) speed. Empirical results from a survey of 265 Chinese firms show that both OI breadth and OI depth positively affect NPD speed. More importantly, we find that an efficient BM strengthens the positive effect of OI depth while it weakens the positive effect of OI breadth. We also find that a novel BM strengthens the positive effect of OI breadth while it weakens the positive effect of OI depth. This research contributes to OI literature by underscoring the importance of matching the BMs to the OI strategies to facilitate NPD.

In this respect, the innovation competency of design consulting firms is unprecedentedly regarded as a deciding competitive edge. This study examines the effects of design innovation competencies as personal innovation competency, organizational innovation competency, and technological innovation competency on the competitiveness of the design outsourcing service in meditating design innovativeness. Data were collected through a survey conducted among 392 design consulting enterprises by way of random sampling over seven regions in Korea. As a result of hypothesis verification, it turned out that the personal innovation competency of designers at design consulting enterprises and technological innovation competency, which represents their design methods and skills, had significant effects on design innovativeness. In contrast, organizational innovation competency showed no significant effects on design innovativeness. For a design consulting enterprise to become an innovative one with better outsourcing service competitiveness, it needs to pursue a strategic direction of strengthening designers' personal innovation and technological design innovation.

389,"Recently, the small and micro enterprises have earned significant fame in the management and entrepreneurship discipline. Researchers have examined the turnover intention of employees working within formal organizations, but ignored the employees working within small and micro enterprises. The aim of this study is to analyze the moderating effects of supervisor support on the relationship between illegitimate tasks and turnover intention of the employees of small and micro enterprises. An interview-administered questionnaire approach was used for data collection, and the snowball sampling technique was employed in this study to contact employees who were working within small and micro enterprises. The sample size was 420 employees from Lahore city (the provincial capital city of Punjab, Pakistan). Results showed that supervisor support would moderate the impact of illegitimate tasks on turnover intention, and a high level of support available from supervisor to the employee at the workplace would make them less likely to leave the organization as opposed to an employee who has less supervisor support at the workplace. The study reveals that supervisor support in small and micro enterprises is necessary to reduce or eliminate stress in the environment. Consequently, this study implies that the managers and supervisors of small and micro enterprises should provide logic and explanation to their subordinates and motivate their subordinates as to why they are assigned that particular task instead of any other employee and how important it is. This study contributes to the field of small and micro enterprises by evaluating the relationship between illegitimate tasks and turnover intention. This study is unique because management scholars have more often studied employees’ behavior in large corporations rather than in small and micro enterprises.

Certainly as far as HTSFs are concerned, it is argued that the ideas behind greater openness during innovation are not well suited to the way in which this type of firm innovates. Moreover, it is argued more generally that the work of Chesbrough can be criticised for overstating the potential for greater openness in terms of industrial research and development, since a degree of openness has always existed, while simultaneously understating the merits of closed innovation systems.

Due to this intermediary role, they act as paradigmatic Open Innovation actors. In this context, RTOs need to balance their knowledge stocks and flows, while assuring their own innovation capabilities and positively impacting the innovation system they influence. Thus, RTOs need to develop collaboration approaches that support their own performance while increasing their capabilities and not threatening their competitive advantages derived from their knowledge stock. In this study we extend the OI research to research organisations analysing their OI approach and the impact on its own performance, developing a new framework for OI study in RTOs using a partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) approach. The research, based on a sample of Spanish RTOs, arises two substantive conclusions. First, an increased number of collaboration partners (collaboration breadth) and the use of a variety of OI practices have a strong impact on RTOs' overall performance (scientific, transference, and economic results). Second, RTOs need to foster their aperture and promote an active management to benefit from collaborating partners, whereas managers should pay special attention to questions related to the protection and management of intellectual property when promoting the use of dierent OI practices.

It proposes a comprehensive concept of the quality of interaction in innovation communities, and presents findings of three case studies, which explore the role of promotors and networks of promotors in Open Innovation.

We conceptualise a theoretical model and test it on entrepreneurs samples from two countries (Slovenia and United States) by means of structural equation modelling. The results suggest that entrepreneurial openness is an important antecedent of absorptive capacity and that too much focus on maintaining the same business contacts (network closeness) prevents the company from absorbing trends from outside the company and network.

In particular, it examines the effect of collaborations with competitors (i.e. coopetition) on the organizational performance of clubs via both use of outside knowledge and the adoption of new services, processes, and business models (i.e. organizational-level innovations). Research methods: A statewide online survey with 292 members of the board of directors of nonprofit sports clubs was conducted in Germany (Saarland). The survey used valid and reliable scales and considered self-reported financial stability and membership development as organizational performance indicators. Structural equation modeling was applied to test the mediation model. Results and findings: The proposed coopetition-based Open Innovation model has a good model fit. Engagement in coopetition has a positive effect on organizational performance via two sequential mediators: use of outside knowledge and innovation implementation. In addition, use of outside knowledge has a direct positive effect on organizational performance.

400,"Research Summary: Companies sponsor platform ecosystems as an Open Innovation strategy to encourage complementors to develop complementary products, services, or technologies that can add value to the platform ecosystem. In this study, we develop and test an information-based theory of entrepreneurial activity within platform ecosystems. We postulate that ecosystems produce different types of information—a subset of which will foster entrepreneurship in the form of the commercialization of complementary products that were previously released for free. Our results indicate that product-specific information is associated with commercialization, but we fail to detect a relationship between market information and subsequent commercialization activity. Managerial Summary: The digital economy has led to a proliferation of platform ecosystems that harness external innovation. These ecosystems rely on complementors who enhance the value of platforms by creating complementary technologies. Hence, complementors' commercial viability is important. One such type of ecosystem is an app store, which enables complementors to introduce software that improves the platform product. App stores exist for a variety of software platforms, ranging from mobile phone operating systems (iOS and Android) to electronic medical record systems (Epic and Cerner). In this research, we find that complementors who introduce a free version of a mobile app are more likely to commercialize their app in response to specific types of information and platform designers should manage information in their platforms to foster platform viability.

401,"Research Summary: In recent decades, two emergent phenomena have jointly transformed the nature and pursuit of entrepreneurship across industries and sectors: Open Innovation and platformization. Open Innovation involves a shift toward more open and distributed models of innovation, while platformization refers to the increasing importance of digital platforms as a venue for value creation and capture. Together, Open Innovation and platforms have created numerous opportunities for entrepreneurs and their firms—from serving as inputs for innovation for established firms to participating as complementors on existing platforms. While these entrepreneurial opportunities (and conditions) have manifested themselves in rich and varied ways, our understanding of these new forms of entrepreneurship has lagged behind. In this essay, and in this special issue, our objective is to bring a sharper focus on the important research issues and questions that frame Open Innovation, platforms, and entrepreneurship. Managerial Summary: Digital platforms and Open Innovation environments have unleashed numerous promising opportunities for entrepreneurs, in industries ranging from consumer software, entertainment, and home appliances to auto, health, and energy. To pursue those opportunities, however, entrepreneurs will need to gain a deeper understanding of the factors that facilitate and constrain them.

402,"Research Summary: Open Innovation is about firms harnessing knowledge flows across firm boundaries, but limited research has examined the nature and antecedents of these flows for start-up firms, as well as the interdependence of inbound and outbound flows. From a new sample of start-up firms making 3D printers, we show how their degree of openness for inbound and outbound knowledge flows relates to the firms’ initial capabilities and founding intentions. From this, we suggest that the patterns of openness are influenced more by initial factor endowments than a firm-specific process of emergent strategy development. Managerial Summary: Innovative firms often face trade-offs between open and proprietary strategies, particularly in industries and segments where online communities and other collaborations provide a pool of shared knowledge for the entire industry. This study illuminates these trade-offs by comparing the choices made by the founders of 3D printer manufacturers. For products based on modular systems, it shows the range of choices that firms have on their degree of inbound openness (using external technology) and outbound openness (sharing their own technology)—as well as the interdependencies of these choices. Finally, it points to long-term implications of early entrepreneurial decisions: firms that leverage external technology can enter markets more quickly, but their innovation options will be limited unless they have capabilities for proprietary innovation.

403,"Researchers have identified Open Innovation as two dimensions, external technology acquisition and external technology exploitation. This study explores the direct and interactive effects of these two dimensions on firm performance and further examines the moderation effects of two factors (i.e., internal R&D and environmental turbulence) on the relationship between both types of Open Innovation and firm performance. Based on Chesbrough's Open Innovation model, multi-item scales were developed to measure two dimensions of firm-level Open Innovation. Survey results of 176 Taiwanese high tech manufacturing firms provide support for most hypotheses. The result shows that external technology acquisition positively affects firm performance, whereas external technology exploitation does not. This study also finds that external technology acquisition strengthens the relationship between external technology exploitation and firm performance. Both external technology acquisition and external technology exploitation are positively related to firm performance under high internal R&D investment and a turbulent market environment. However, technological turbulence only positively affects the relationship between external technological acquisition, but not external technology exploitation, and firm performance.

In this paper, we extend Open Innovation model both theoretically and practically by identifying a) the boundary conditions that motivate firms within resource-based industries to apply the model and b) the approaches that have been implemented in practice in applying the model. In this multiple-case study, we explore why and how firms within the upstream Canadian oil industry have evolved to apply Open Innovation model over time to deal with the industry's challenges. First, our findings show that institutional forces, both normative and coercive—such as social and environmental pressures, were the primary drivers for adopting Open Innovation. Second, by building on the taxonomy of meta-organizations, we demonstrate that an industry-founded and not-for-profit innovation intermediary, as a meta-organization, is a necessary tool to address problems of adopting Open Innovation. We argue that the experiments of the upstream oil industry to develop a suitable organizational design for such innovation intermediaries suggest that a moderate level of stratification accompanying either close or open membership is the most suitable design. The findings from this study can be helpful to other industries, particularly other resource- based industries, which seek to effectively employ the Open Innovation model through innovation intermediaries.

From a strategic perspective, we propose that ETC may result in the loss of competitive advantages through the disclosure of internal knowledge (or areas the firm is working in) or through the suboptimal allocation of R&D resources, and thereby affects a firm’s performance negatively. Finally, we propose specific implications for management and research on when and how often companies should practice ETC, and illustrate related practical experience by a case study. We thereby propose an inversely U-shaped relationship between ETC’s intensity and the firm’s profit contribution. ",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.039,0.033,-0.007,-0.006,0.019,-0.016

The increasing number of SMEs have resulted in the business landscape to become more and more competitive. This has made SMEs to also undergo great challenges to be able to maintain their existence and expand their businesses. It is argued that the enterprise resource planning system (ERPs) can improve business performance. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study is to examine the impact of an ERPs usage on the financial and non-financial performance of the Saudi SMEs. An exploratory study has been used to identify the factors contributing to the effective and successful use of an ERP system. The findings indicate seven contingency factors. Based on the exploratory study results, three hypotheses have been developed and tested in a quantitative study. A survey is constructed and sent to 200 Saudi SMEs that adopted the ERP systems. About 120 valid responses have been received. For data analysis and hypothesis testing, a structural equation modelling (SEM) tool has been adopted. The results depict that management support, user satisfaction, and training significantly impact the ERPs usage. Another significant finding is that ERP systems enhance SMEs' performance.

Given the importance of collaborative efforts between multiple stakeholders, we address the Open Innovation challenges from the SME perspective at the business-ecosystem level. We present an inductive case study of a particular regional ecosystem and focus on the inter-organizational collaboration between SMEs and other stakeholders in the ecosystem. With this focus, we explore how SMEs perceive, organize, and manage Open Innovation through strong collaborative ties with other ecosystem members. We identify a particular set of challenges for the SMEs due to the misalignment between their business model and that of their ecosystem. Specific findings include the link between innovation type expressed by diverging understandings of the notion of innovation across the ecosystem and the innovation form (here, Open Innovation), which should be organized and managed on multiple levels of analysis (SME, inter-organizational, and ecosystem). These findings highlight specific attention points for managing and developing Open Innovation in a regional business ecosystem, and they contribute both to the business-ecosystem literature as well as Open Innovation literature.

416,"Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) largely depend on proficient idea generation activities to improve their front-end innovation performance, yet the liabilities of newness and smallness often hamper SMEs' ability to benefit from systematic idea generation. To compensate for these liabilities, many SMEs adopt an Open Innovation approach by collaborating with market-based partners such as customers and suppliers. This study investigates the relationship between SMEs' systematic idea generation and front-end performance and investigates the moderating role of market-based partnership for SMEs. Drawing on a survey of 146 Swedish manufacturing SMEs, this study provides two key contributions. First, the systematic idea generation and front-end performance relationship in SMEs is non-linear. Accordingly, higher levels of front-end performance are achieved when idea generation activities are highly systematic. Second, the returns from higher levels of systematic idea generation are positively moderated by market-based partnerships. Thus, external cooperation with customers and suppliers pays off most toward front-end performance when SMEs have highly systematic idea generation processes. These results indicate a contingency perspective on the role of external partnerships. They also have implications for research into the front-end of innovation and Open Innovation in the context of SMEs. ",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.04,-0.006,-0.001,-0.038,-0.117,-0.017

419,"Societies face difficult challenges which require responses that go beyond the innovation capability of most public sector organisations. Open approaches to public sector innovation that exploits digital technologies have been proposed for some years to close this gap, but our knowledge of the use and outcome of using Open Innovation in this context is limited. This research takes stock of the study and use of these approaches by investigating the purposes for which public sector organisations use Open Innovation, and how it creates value. The research question is answered through a systematic literature review and an analysis of publicly available data about the Open Innovation projects referred to in that literature. The research identifies five different purposes of using Open Innovation. It also suggests that public sector organisations primarily use Open Innovation to pursue one specific purpose: innovation in society. When using Open Innovation for this purpose, public sector organisations attempt to create value by improving citizens' quality of life and the quality of neighbourhoods. They do this primarily by co-specialising IT and other resources in society (e.g. the transportation system) and by using the outcome of this co-specialisation process to change citizen behaviour, capabilities and experiences (e.g. encouraging citizens to use the transportation system more efficiently or making citizens feel more safe when using the transportation system). This research indicates that Open Innovation is generally not used to open up public sector organisations or to give citizens more influence in public sector or democratic processes. The research also indicates that Open Innovation, until now, has primarily been used to solve minor problems, and not large scale wicked problems in society. The research suggests a framework for value creation from Open Innovation initiatives that pursues innovation in society. This framework might help public sector organisations increase value creation and solve wicked problems using Open Innovation, and might help researchers to focus future Open Innovation research on essential knowledge gaps.

Yet, little is known about how management of contingencies such as absorptive capacity or technology radicalness can impact the innovation speed of firms. In this explorative study, we provide new empirical evidence to the innovation speed literature. We examine to what extent innovation speed is affected by organisational, technological, and relational contingencies that preoccupy firms with Open Innovation practices. Taking the firm perspective, we track innovation timeline and emphasise the complex trade-offs that firms encounter while innovating. Our results show that many of the contingencies, emphasised by the literature promoting innovation, could slow down its speed. Thus, strengthening competitiveness by accommodating contingencies can hinder time-critical adaptations.

422,"Subsequent to the decades of research and business advancement in sustainable development, the importance of sustainability is undoubtful; however, existing paths toward it are not yet sufficient. Correspondingly, innovation has recently emerged as a persuasive means to enhance sustainability. As with all conventional innovations, the integration of broad and diverse actors in innovation projects aimed particularly at sustainable development is essential, but it is argued to require reconciliation, owing to the peculiarities of the sustainability context. The innovation literature (particularly the Open Innovation stream) extensively investigates and is able to provide us with businesses’ capabilities for integrating external actors for conventional innovation projects. Elaborated from the literature, we identify and conceptualize four capabilities as bundles of open conventional innovation capability – namely, networking, competence mapping, relational, and desorptive capabilities. Starting from the conceptual framework of open conventional innovation capabilities, eight innovation projects aimed particularly at sustainability with diverse and broad actors were used as an empirical context for qualitative, multiple-case studies. The results suggest that open sustainability-oriented innovation capabilities conform to the open conventional innovation capability framework; however, the capabilities must be reconciled with the particular sustainability context. In particular, the results suggest that desorptive capability (the ability of aligning/empowering internals for external acquirements) requires particular and strong reconciliation with the sustainability context, whereas the required reconciliation of networking, competence mapping and relational capabilities strongly depends on the outcome characteristics. In this regard, the findings reveal that for innovations to develop a sustainable product-service system that would dramatically change existing systems and consumers’ lifestyles, capability reconciliation is required for all key partners of the project. On the other hand, for innovations to develop a sustainable product or service, established open conventional innovation capabilities can be used.

424,"Sustainability and social media use in Open Innovation play important roles in a firm's new product development (NPD) process. This research examines, in conjunction, the roles of sustainability and social media driven inbound Open Innovation (SMOI) for a firm's NPD performance, and further, takes a more refined approach by differentiating between different types of SMOI activities. To this end, this research develops and tests a conceptual framework, which predicts that (1) a firm's sustainability orientation (SO) is positively associated with its NPD performance, (2) customer focus (CF) partially mediates the SO–NPD performance link, and (3) particular SMOI activities moderate the CF–NPD performance link. The empirical results, using data from the Product Development and Management Association (PDMA)'s comparative performance assessment study, provide support for most of the framework. Notably, this research documents a positive link between SO and NPD performance, as well as a partial mediating role of CF. The results further suggest that social media driven Open Innovation activities focused on gathering market insights enhance CF directly, while social media driven Open Innovation activities that garner technical expertise enhance the link between CF and NPD performance. This paper bridges the separate literatures on sustainability and Open Innovation, and contributes to the NPD research. The findings suggest that managers should take a strategic approach to sustainability and embed it in the NPD process. Furthermore, managers should manage social media based Open Innovation carefully to fully benefit the firm during the front end and back end of NPD.

Our paper addresses this gap in the literature through an in-depth case study of a sustainability oriented innovation process for a radical new product within a multinational life sciences company, DSM. Our findings identify five critical organizational practices through which strategic direction has enabled the innovation process: technology super-scouting throughout the value chain, search heuristics that favor radical sustainability solutions, integration of sustainability performance metrics in product development, championing the value chain to build demand for radical sustainability oriented product innovation, and harnessing the benefits of Open Innovation.

Our simulation research allows for modelling the micro-foundations of Open Innovation and for studying innovation strategies in different market conditions. We find that the relative financial payoffs associated with the different innovation strategies vary over time: some strategies win out in the short-term, others in the long-term. Our results also suggest that a focused closed innovation strategy can lead to higher financial performance when all the resources are concentrated on internal R&D and commercialisation.

Hence, industry is engaged in an accelerated automation race where industrial automation converts value chains into intelligent, data-driven systems. This generates new business models and spurs firm competitiveness in general. Companies thus pay attention to the development, acquisition, and incorporation of related technologies to profit from these developments in specific. For this, they must incorporate external flows of knowledge to succeed in innovation. Yet, there is a dearth of research that links Open Innovation to the incorporation of industrial automation, and to firm performance. Hence, this paper takes a knowledge-based view of the firm and sheds light on the moderating role of the processes of Open Innovation on the economic results of firms’ subject to automation. In order to do so, we estimate the impact of the interaction of Open Innovation and automation on firm turnover using panel data for 5287 Spanish firms from a variety of manufacture and service industries. We separate the effects for different open-innovation partners and find that turnover is increased for those automating firms that engage in Open Innovation with suppliers. These results indicate that suppliers possess the knowledge required for successful automation, and firms that innovate together with suppliers fare better at leveraging investments in automation. In addition, automating firms should exercise caution when choosing collaboration partners from the same country. ",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.06,0.094,-0.016,0.01,0.061,-0.012

In this paper, we aim to contribute to these debates through a bibliometric review of the first decade of Open Innovation research. We combine two techniques—bibliographic coupling and co-citation analysis—to (1) visualize the network of publications that explicitly use the label ‘Open Innovation’ and (2) to arrive at distinct clusters of thematically related publications. Our findings illustrate that Open Innovation research builds principally on four related streams of prior research, whilst the bibliographic network of Open Innovation research reveals that seven thematic clusters have been pursued persistently. While such persistence is undoubtedly useful to arrive at in-depth and robust insights, the observed patterns also signal the absence of new, emerging, themes. As such, ‘Open Innovation’ might benefit from applying its own ideas: sourcing concepts and models from a broader range of theoretical perspectives as well as pursuing a broader range of topics might introduce dynamics resulting in more impact and proliferation.

443,"The concept of Open Innovation has gained traction among practitioners and academics. Many different aspects of Open Innovation have been researched, but the question of how to manage Open Innovation collaboration in order to achieve the desired knowledge flow across organizational boundaries remains only partly answered. Consequently, this article argues for the need to complement prior firm-centric perspectives by investigating the roles of senior management in the postmodern form of organizing that characterizes Open Innovation collaboration. A more in-depth understanding of managerial roles in this context can increase the chances of fruitful collaboration. Thus, the article uses an inductive, interview-based approach to explore senior management roles in two institutionalized Open Innovation collaborations, thereby creating an initial conceptualization of the role of managers in Open Innovation and forming a basis for further studies on Open Innovation management. In this respect, the article identifies and discusses additional managerial roles that appear to be crucial for Open Innovation collaborations. These roles are those of a facilitator, tactician, and sensegiver. ",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.024,-0.007,-0.009,0.014,0.009,-0.007
444,"The concept of Open Innovation has recently gained wide academic attention, as it seems to have significant impact for company performance. Most empirical investigations about this emerging concept have been case studies of successful early adopters of Open Innovation, and their analyses have largely been at the company level. Although case studies at that level provide meaningful implications, the new phenomena merit a more in-depth examination: that is, we need to collect and analyze data on multiple companies to explore more systematic findings about Open Innovations across companies. Moreover, analyses may need to go down to the individual project rather than the whole company level because innovation activities are often conducted as part of research and development (R&D) projects. To meet these needs, this study examines companies' Open Innovation efforts at the level of the individual R&D project. Specifically, the present study focuses on project-level openness to better understand the mechanisms of Open Innovation. It explores systematic relationships between various antecedent factors and the degree of openness. Project-level openness could be affected by team and task characteristics, such as team size, learning distance, strategic importance, technology and market uncertainty, and relevance to the main business. Relevant data collected from 303 companies in Korea were used to identify the antecedents that affect inbound and outbound openness. The research findings are expected to help provide a concrete theoretical framework suited for more generalized application and further practical development of Open Innovation strategy.

445,"The concept of Open Innovation has recently gained widespread attention. It is particularly relevant now because many firms are required to implement Open Innovation, despite the difficulties associated with managing these activities. After providing a definition of Open Innovation delimiting it from open source, an overview of prior research is given, which identifies the following important topics of earlier Open Innovation research: technology transactions, user innovation, business models, and innovation markets. In light of current controversial debates about the value of the Open Innovation framework, we evaluate the literature and assess whether Open Innovation is a sustainable trend rather than a management fashion. On this basis, we present a conceptual framework that provides the foundation for discussing critical Open Innovation processes and their implications for managing Open Innovation at the organizational, project, and individual level. Thus, we assess the multilevel determinants of the make-or-buy, integrate-or-relate, and keep-or-sell decisions in opening up the innovation process. Then, we propose a research agenda based on this conceptual framework with particular emphasis on the organizational antecedents and performance consequences of Open Innovation and on important research design issues.

446,"The concept of Open Innovation has successfully diffused in academia as well as in industry. However, criticisms have at the same time been raised regarding the lack of a precise definition and also similar past research has not been sufficiently recognized. This paper highlights two perspectives of openness related to innovation - open as 'libre' versus 'controlled' - arguing that they rest on different underlying assumptions and theoretical foundations related to knowledge and value production. The paper concludes that the general research on 'Open Innovation' implicitly utilizes both perspectives, which tends to give a somewhat fragmented and incoherent perception of what Open Innovation is and how it should be applied in practice.

447,"The concept of Open Innovation, building upon ideas of ""interactive innovation"" and ""innovation networking"" has gained interest more recently. It argues that companies should increasingly also rely on ideas and knowledge developed externally, and create external paths for innovation. There are various mechanisms used by companies for acquiring external knowledge such as R&D and innovation collaboration with other firms and universities, relations to spin-off companies, and informal knowledge interactions within local milieux and ""Open Innovation campuses"". Open Innovation and networking are no general phenomena but depend on certain company and regional characteristics such as the respective innovation culture. The interrelationship between Open Innovation and regional culture has been explored by studies on regional advantage emphasizing socio-cultural aspects of opening up innovation, the literature on regional clusters, emphasizing knowledge sharing in networks, and the contributions to regional innovation systems, emphasizing the role of the institutional environment. We investigate examples of Open Innovation for different regions of Europe including high-tech and low-tech industries: The Southeast region of The Netherlands (high-tech systems centred on Philips and performance materials centred on DSM), Basel (Life Science industry focused on Novartis and other firms) and Styria (metal industry). We analyse the ways and mechanisms at work for Open Innovation, and the way these are related to regional culture. We find that Open Innovation strategies of companies benefit from certain regional culture characteristics and that there is no uniform ""model of Open Innovation that applies to all types of regions"". Region-specific solutions and policies are required that account for divergent regional conditions. The research shows that we rarely find the ideal model of ""uncontrolled"" Open Innovation, but rather different forms of innovation practices that are somewhere in between the open and the closed model. Both corporate cultures and regional cultures in the regions studied still show many aspects hampering Open Innovation, underlining that change towards a culture facilitating Open Innovation takes considerable time.

454,"The decrease in the economic activity level around the world due to the COVID-19 pandemic spread has led to a sharp decrease in the crude oil price and provoked an oil war outbreak in the global energy market. The current situation has provoked the need for a total decrease in the crude oil production in the world. Considering that Russia is one of the main oil exporters on the world market, the need to determine the supply and demand levels for Russian oil is becoming relevant. The aim of the paper is to model predictive scenarios of Russian oil industry development, considering the specifics of the current economic environment given the COVID-19 pandemic. The multifactor correlation modeling method was used to form the system of indicators determining the level of demand and supply for Russian oil used and the total level of their influence. The functions determine the probability of implementing various scenarios of oil industry development depending on the predicted values of demand and supply. The three-sigma rule and the fuzzy sets method were used to estimate three scenarios of oil industry development for 2020-2021. Changes in revenues of the industry under the influence of forecast indicators of supply and demand for oil have been assessed and the probability of implementation of each of the scenarios has been reasoned. The results obtained are of a practical nature and can be used by government agencies, financial intermediaries, and scientists to diagnose Russian oil industry development. The results will be useful for oil companies to develop a strategy of Open Innovations for further design of the scientific information field for the effective functioning of the industry in complete uncertainty conditions.

We focus on two distinctive types of FFs: those held and managed by family members and FFs where ownership and management are disjointed, leading to non-family managers being involved in strategic decision-making. Our study shows that FFs managed by non-family managers are motivated by an innovation strategy that is more aggressive, more oriented towards technological excellence and radical innovation as compared to FFs managed by family managers. And they are more likely to search for a broader set of external sources in embracing OI. We argue that the presence of non-family managers is what makes the difference in shaping firm behaviour in terms of OI breadth. ",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.028,0.01,0.04,0.011,0.014,-0.001

459,"The digital age allows for integration of dispersed groups into the innovation process. These heterogeneous groups of individuals varying in size and knowledge distribution, also referred to as crowds, build the basis for Open Innovation contests (OIC), one of the most common forms of crowdsourcing innovation. Different from more focused forms of Open Innovation, at OIC innovation managers often do not identify or evaluate participants ex-ante. Instead, innovation managers often make use of open calls for participation and assume efficient self-selection of participants i.e., that only motivated and qualified participants will volunteer and engage in the innovation contest. This behavior reflects one of the key assumption of crowdsourcing in participatory innovation settings. However, not every self-selected member is in the position to solve the contest task appropriately. Hence, innovation contests often result in large numbers of submissions, covering a wide range of quality levels, causing decision biases and significant workloads for innovation managers to select ideas. This problem is referred to as ""crowding"". In order to reduce ""crowding"", Open Innovation researchers are interested in understanding which types of individuals make the ""best"" contributions and therefore should be preferably encouraged to participate in in OIC. In this paper, we are assessing what characterizes those participants who submit innovative ideas to OIC, in particular those who submit incremental ideas vs. those who have more radical ideas. Drawing on the componential model of creativity and data generated in innovation contest held by chocolate producer Ritter Sport, we analyze the effect of participants' creativity, domain knowledge, and several motivational factors on the innovativeness of their contributions. We find all of these factors to affect the innovativeness of an idea. However, regarding generating incremental or radical innovations, some factors have opposing roles. Our findings imply for practice that innovation managers must decide which type of innovations they intend to generate and then design contests to attract participants with the required characteristics, if they want to increase the number of appropriate ideas and reduce the problems of ""crowding"".",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.028,-0.024,-0.029,0.015,-0.016,-0.026

469,"The fourth industrial revolution, termed Industry 4.0, offers a vital and valuable opportunity to drive social and technological innovations. It has state-of-the-art cyber-physical systems and related technological architecture, which can drastically increase a firm's productivity and innovation performance. Nevertheless, Industry 4.0 is also significantly shortening the product life cycles and demanding the pace of innovation to be accelerated. A firm, however, cannot accelerate the pace of its innovation by exclusively relying only on its internal resources. This is the reason firms are increasingly adopting Open Innovation strategy through collaboration with external stakeholders. The critical challenge that firms are facing while managing Open Innovation is trust among the stakeholders. Digital trust, attained through Industry 4.0 technologies, can play an instrumental role in promoting Open Innovation. Against this backdrop, the present study investigates the impact of digital trust on Open Innovation performance. The study investigates the role of technological orientation and technological absorption capacity in the association between digital trust and Open Innovation. Cross-country data of 324 electrical and electronics firms of three major Asia-Pacific countries, namely Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand, were collected using a close-ended questionnaire. The study employed partial least square-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and PLS-multi group analysis (PLS-MGA) to analyze the modeled relationships. The results reveal that digital trust, composed of trust and Industry 4.0 technologies, has a significant positive impact on a firm's Open Innovation. Likewise, results also depict a strongly positive moderating role of technological orientation in the association between digital trust and Open Innovation. Finally, results also exhibit a significant mediating role of both potential and realized technological absorptive capacities in the association of digital trust and Open Innovation.

470,"The Home Energy Management System (HEMS) is a system for the efficient electric power consumption of each household. It can provide real-time electricity cost information according to electricity consumption, and households can immediately control their consumption of electricity. In this study, we analyzed the effects of the HEMS on the stability of demand for electric power. To do this, we analyzed the causal relationship between the amounts of electric power generation and consumption, from the system dynamics perspective. From the analysis, we found that in the current structure, the fluctuation of the quantity of demand became large due to the time delay in households recognizing the electric bill and adjusting their electric power consumption. However, when the HEMS was introduced, it could be seen that electric power demand remained stable since consumers could see their electricity bill in real-time and could manage their electricity consumption by themselves.

471,"The implementation of Open Innovation models for RD activities has been extensively tested by many public and private institutions by using several models; however, both lessons learned and rationale for internal decision-making have not been systematically analyzed to serve as a basis for future institutional process management improvements, which increase the success rate. The large diversity of cases, firms, sectors and open activities, and the multiple factors affecting success has made it difficult to elaborate a general framework where to extract from some policy design rules adapted to specific contexts; thus, involved firms do not have a consolidated framework to measure the effectiveness of the Open Innovation practices in use. Open Innovation for RD activities conducted by multinational firms is usually carried out at the international level looking for specific knowledge and complementarity of partners. One of the critical factors for success in Open Innovation activities is the 'right selection of adequate partners'. This paper postulates that the multi-variable selection based on the previous characterization of the relationship between the firm and one potential international partner constitutes a key factor for success. In addition, the article presents a semi-quantitative approach to measure the 'differences' (a metrics based on 'proximity' is defined) to analyze and compare between different partners from several dimensions. The key goal is to select external partners with the 'minimum distance' to the firm. The proposed selection metrics were applied to various open research projects launched with university partners in the three Latin American countries (Mexico, Chile, and Peru).

To fill this gap, this study explores intra-organizational and inter-organizational control and their interaction effect on NPD performance in Open Innovation. The results show that intra-organizational formal control and inter-organizational trust positively influence NPD performance, whereas intra-organizational professional control and inter-organizational contract control have no significant effect. The interaction effect between inter-organizational and inter-organizational control positively influence NPD performance.

473,"The inbound Open Innovation process consists of the opening of the innovation funnel to the contribution of external partners, with the aim of tapping into their knowledge. This opportunity is particularly valuable for family firms (FFs), which often have insufficient resources. However, the literature on the OI behaviour of family firms is not conclusive. Indeed, both the behavioural theory (BT) and the resource-based view (RBV) posit negative and positive outcomes regarding openness choices in FFs. We claim that these contrasting results can be reconciled if, according to the literature, FFs are seen as a heterogeneous breed, whose differences are determined by different levels of participation of non-family members in the governance mechanisms. Indeed, non-family members can act in favour of OI. However, previous literature has failed to satisfactorily grasp the nuances of this heterogeneity. We suggest that it is necessary to adequately operationalize the heterogeneity concept by means of fuzzy logic. We conducted a survey on 178 Italian FFs. Results show that the involvement of non-family members affects the extent to which firms draw on knowledge from external partners. Specifically, the higher the involvement of non-family members, the more there is collaboration with vertical partners along the supply chain.

Traditional business strategy has guided firms to develop defensible positions against the forces of competition and power in the value chain, implying the importance of constructing barriers rather than promoting value creation through openness. Recently, however, firms and even whole industries, such as the software industry, are experimenting with novel business models based on harnessing collective creativity through Open Innovation. The apparent success of some of these experiments challenges prevailing views of strategy. At the same time, many of these experimenters now are grappling with issues related to value capture and sustainability of their business models, as well as issues of corporate influence and the potential co-option of open initiatives. These issues bring us back to traditional business strategy, which can offer important insights.

476,"The Internet of Things (IoT) has led towards a digital world in which everything becomes connected. Unfortunately, most of the currently marketed connected devices feed vertically-oriented closed systems (commonly referred to as vertical silos) which prevent the development of a unified global IoT. This issue is all the more valid in complex environments, such as smart cities, in which exceedingly large amounts of heterogeneous sensor data are collected, and in which platforms and stakeholders should also be able to interact and cooperate. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to move towards the creation of open IoT ecosystems to support efficient smart city service integration, discovery and composition. This paper contributes to the specifications of such an ecosystem, which has been developed as part of the EU's H2020 bIoTope project. The novelty of this ecosystem compared with the current literature is threefold: (i) it is based on the extensive use of open communication and data standards, notably O-MI and O-DF standards, that foster technical, syntactic and semantic interoperability over domains; (ii) it proposes an innovative service marketplace for data/service publication, discovery and incentivization; (iii) it integrates security functionalities at the IoT gateway level. The practicability of our ecosystem has been validated through several smart city proofs-of-concept set up in three distinct cities: Helsinki, Lyon and Brussels. Given the five major themes defined in the CITYKeys (a smart city performance indicator framework), namely People, Planet, Prosperity, Governance and Propagation, bIoTope mainly contributes to Prosperity-related metrics, as discussed in this paper.

477,"The lack of efficiency and transparency regarding cross-company collaboration in the field of Open Innovation often leads to cost intensive and unsuccessful products and services. This is because traditional approaches fail to cope with emerging requirements in innovation projects, e.g., the vertical and horizontal integration of strategic partners within and across the company’s value network. However, to maintain their competitive advantage, companies seek a constant and sustainable development of their product and service portfolio. In this context, knowledge work plays an important role in the collaborative development of innovative product and service ideas. For that reason, knowledge workers need systematic support regarding both methodological and operational challenges. The concept of Adaptive Case Management emerged from the necessity to support knowledge workers in unpredictable and highly creative working environments, especially in the field of Business Process Management. Therefore, the contribution shows, both from a conceptual and technological point of view, how to combine those approaches to support knowledge workers in dynamic innovation projects. To test the validity of the concept, a software prototype serves as the foundation for interviews with experts of the innovation department of a large international industrial company.

478,"The literature on “Open Innovation” so far focuses almost exclusively on strategic issues. In this largely conceptual paper we propose behavioral foundations for knowledge exchange and knowledge sharing to address this gap in the literature. Innovation and knowledge development that result from knowledge transfer, is an uncertain and cumulative process that typically involves a number of parties. Knowledge transfer between people and firms has been fruitfully studied from a structural or network perspective. The social network literature however, faces an “action problem”. Focusing on structural elements such as an agent’s position in a network and the types of relations entertained cannot explain why actors actually do share knowledge. The exchange of knowledge is elusive and is a discretionary act for the people involved, certainly in the case of Open Innovation. It is argued here that social network analysis is to be complemented by the concept of gift exchange, drawing on social exchange literature. Gift exchange–following Mauss’ dictum to “give, receive and reciprocate”– establishes obligations between people especially under circumstances of ambiguity, which explain why and how knowledge exchange relations are established, persist, and may also end. Relationships in a social network and the social capital that inheres in these cannot be drawn on at will to exchange knowledge. These obligations established by gift exchange between individuals who share a connection explain why agents exchange knowledge with each other even in the absence of markets or hierarchy.

This study aimed to identify the key factors that characterize the millennial generation within the online chatter on Twitter using an innovative approach. To this end, we analyzed the user generated content (UGC) in the social network (SNS) Twitter using a three-steps knowledge-based method for information management. In order to develop this method, we first used latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a state-of-the-art thematic modeling tool that works with Python, to analyze topics in our database. The data were collected by extracting tweets with the hashtag #Millennial, #Millennials and #MillennialGeneration on Twitter (n = 35,401 tweets). Secondly, sentiment analysis with a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was also developed using machine-learning. Applying this method to the LDA results resulted in the categorization of the topics into those that contained negative, positive and neutral sentiments. Thirdly, in order to gather the final results, data text mining techniques were used. The negative factors that characterize the behavior of this generation are depression, loneliness and real-world relationship. The positive factors are body image, self-expression, travelers and digital life and the neutral factors are self-identity and anxiety. Practical implications can be used by public actors, companies or policy makers that are focused on the millennial generation as a target.

482,"The model of ""Open Innovations"" Open Innovation can be compared with the ""Triple Helix of University-Industry-Government Relations"" (TH) as attempts to find surplus value in bringing industrial innovation closer to public R & D. Whereas the firm is central in the model of OI, the TH adds multi-centeredness: in addition to firms, universities and (e. g., regional) governments can take leading roles in innovation eco-systems. In addition to the (transversal) technology transfer at each moment of time, one can focus on the dynamics in the feedback loops. Under specifiable conditions, feedback loops can be turned into feedforward ones that drive innovation eco-systems towards self-organization and the auto-catalytic generation of new options. The generation of options can be more important than historical realizations (""best practices"") for the longer-term viability of knowledge-based innovation systems. A system without sufficient options, for example, is locked-in. The generation of redundancy-the Triple Helix indicator-can be used as a measure of unrealized but technologically feasible options given a historical configuration. Different coordination mechanisms (markets, policies, knowledge) provide different perspectives on the same information and thus generate redundancy. Increased redundancy not only stimulates innovation in an ecosystem by reducing the prevailing uncertainty; it also enhances the synergy in and innovativeness of an innovation system.

Today, a successful company should be, lean, modular, and with a smart approach to new products development.

A paradigm for this behavior is the Open Innovation one, as created by Chesbrough. According to the rules of this paradigm, companies have to acknowledge that they operate in a network of relationships, they must be open to cooperate with their external partners, and they must not try to limit their actions in reaching only for some pre-defined result.

486,"The Open Innovation paradigm describes how firms innovate by interacting with other organizations. Several authors found that specific OI strategies have a positive effect on economic and industrial innovation performance. Nevertheless, over-search and over-collaboration phenomena might reduce the OI marginal returns when a firm resorts to additional external innovation partners. This article hypothesizes that the variety of external innovation channels (search breadth) used by a firm, the extent to which a firm draws deeply from them (search depth) and the extent to which a firm collaborates through different external channels (coupled OI) are curvilinearly related with innovation performance. The empirical models are estimated using 84,919 firms from Eurostat's Community Innovation Survey, which was conducted in 2008 across European countries. The results suggest that search breadth is curvilinearly related with all the measures of innovation performance, whereas search depth is not subject to diminishing marginal returns in most cases. Furthermore, this article shows that coupled OI is curvilinearly related with the development and commercialization of radically new products.

487,"The Open Innovation paradigm emphasizes the importance of integrating inbound and outbound flows of technology to increase a firm's innovation performance. While the synergies between technology inflows and outflows have been discussed in conceptual OI articles, the majority of empirical studies have typically focused on either the inward or the outward dimension of OI. According to recent reviews of OI literature, there is a need for further research that takes an integrated perspective on this topic and studies the combination of the inbound and outbound dimensions of OI. This paper follows these calls by focusing on technology licensing as the main contractual form for OI, and by investigating the relationship between technology in-licensing and out-licensing activities at the firm level of analysis. In particular, this paper argues that technology in-licensing positively influences the volume of technology out-licensing through two mechanisms. The first—resource-based—occurs because in-licensing investments expand and enrich the firm's technology base, thus increasing its value and, as a result, creating more opportunities for out-licensing. The second—capabilities-based—occurs because, due to commonalities between technology in-licensing and out-licensing in terms of performed tasks and required skills, repeated execution of in-licensing transactions contributes to the development of higher out-licensing capabilities and, as a result, increase out-licensing volume. These arguments are tested using a panel dataset of 837 Spanish manufacturing firms over the period 1998–2007. Consistent with the predictions, the empirical analysis shows that higher investments in in-licensing and more extensive in-licensing experience lead to superior volumes of technology out-licensing. These results contribute to research on OI and licensing, by empirically showing the existence of positive interactions between technology inflows and outflows and of synergies in the development of absorptive and desorptive capacities.

We do not find evidence that external sources of information acquisition are significant in radical service product innovation. By contrast, innovation followers rely more extensively on external sourcing of knowledge and new ideas (with decreasing returns to innovation performance), and tend not to export. These findings contribute significantly to our understanding of the knowledge flows and the asymmetries in knowledge sharing in service sectors across Europe.

499,"The peak power of the manufacturing systems can increase electricity costs and reduce the use of renewable energy suppliers. The power of the machining processes depends on the processing time of the operations. Then, the allocation of the power to the machines of a manufacturing system controls the processing time of the manufacturing operations. An efficient allocation model can reduce the peak power, keeping the throughput performance level. This paper proposes a game theory to allocate the power to the machines including the dependence of the processing time from the power allocated. The game model uses the Gale-Shapley algorithm that forms couples of under and overloaded machines. Then, each couple exchanges the power from the underloaded to overloaded machines. The model considers the global workload and the jobs in queue for each machine. A simulation model tests the proposed method compared to a benchmark where each machine works with fixed power. The simulation results show how the model can improve the performance of the manufacturing system in several conditions tested. In particular, the main benefits can be obtained when the manufacturing system has high or medium utilization or the uncertainty affects the processing time.

500,"The pharmaceutical industry is a high-technology industry that requires a combination of in-depth knowledge from various fields. It is characterized by high cost, high risk and a long-term perspective due to the high level of regulation. In addition, it is known that research and development (R&D) productivity is deteriorating in the industry. Under these conditions, the importance of Open Innovation strategies has been emphasized. Under an Open Innovation system, it is essential for firms to develop several dynamic capabilities to effectively manage their resources both internally and externally. Using a systematic framework of dynamic capabilities suggested by previous studies, this study focuses on the determinants affecting firms' desorptive capacities, which are measured as the number of out-licensing deals, as an indicator for the performance of their outbound innovation. For the analysis, negative binomial regression is employed and inventive capacity and connective capacity are selected as the determinants of the licensors' desorptive capacity. The results of regression analysis reveal that inventive capacity does not have a significant effect on desorptive capacity and that only connective capacity has a significant positive effect on desorptive capacity.

501,"The pharmaceutical industry, where research and development (R & D) efficiency is central to company survival, has recently faced significant challenges. To increase efficiency, companies must implement strategies such as Open Innovation, wherein they sell their intellectual property, maximize their use of external resources, adjust their structures, and implement new business models. In this study, we divided 701 U.S. pharmaceutical companies according to their OI strategies to measure and compare their R & D efficiencies between 2001 and 2016. We analyzed the deal data of companies by first dividing them into four groups (inside-out, outside-in, coupled, and closed) to calculate R & D efficiency using stochastic and meta-frontier analyses. In the first group analysis, the coupled group shows high technical efficiency, but in an overall comparison, the inside-out group achieves the highest efficiency values. These values increased between 2005 and 2010, when the R & D crisis in the industry was great at its highest. We thus identified the characteristics of each group based on our results, and presented extensive analyses using a time-series comparison and enterprise-level analysis. We claim that pharmaceutical companies can still cope with the current R & D crisis by implementing different OI strategies. ",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.033,-0.043,0.0,-0.034,0.016,0.026
502,"The pharmaceutical landscape has changed, and new business models, based on alliances, are increasingly being adopted in this industry. Biotechnology advances have pushed this development, and pooling complementary resources coming from incumbents and newcomers is a key skill to succeed: these are the premises for a quick spread of the Open Innovation (01) paradigm in this industry. R&D portfolio selection needs R&D project evaluation, and Real Options Analysis (ROA) is acknowledged as a powerful tool to evaluate uncertain projects that have an intrinsic flexibility. The present research aims to foster the use of ROA in the 01 field in order to encourage firms to undertake this innovation model; to achieve this goal the authors propose a closed-form model that is easy to implement, to evaluate the 01 initiative for selecting an optimal R&D portfolio. The study wants to support managers in optimal R&D portfolio construction in terms of choosing the most promising products, the means by which the related project has to be undertaken (in an open or closed manner; i.e. licensing-in or not) and the self-financing policy. The proposed model can be easily implemented into a spreadsheet, and the inputs needed to run it are usually requested to evaluate projects using the most used net-present-value-based methods. Moreover, some parameters of the model allow strategic aspects to be considered: for example the nature of the project (core/non-core), the impending project phase, and the risk-sharing opportunity. The results of the developed numerical example show that the selected portfolio is well balanced in terms of development stages, core/non-core therapeutic areas and, licensing-in (an inbound Open Innovation solution), is preferred in the case of products at their early stages of development.

503,"The Power and Energy (P&E) sector needs to respond to several challenges fostering investments in research and development. According to the Open Innovation paradigm, key stakeholders like utilities, vendors, laboratories, universities etc. should take advantage of external knowledge to improve their innovation performance. Several studies have demonstrated that firms adopting the OI paradigm are more likely to innovate. Despite the interest of P&E firms in enhancing their innovation capabilities, surprisingly few articles (usually case studies) described the implementation of the OI paradigm in P&E firms. This article fills the gap by identifying the key drivers that encourage a firm in the P&E sector to embrace the OI paradigm. The authors adopt a hybrid research approach collecting evidence from the literature and through a multiple case-study analysis involving seven British firms and universities operating in the P&E industry. As the drivers of OI have mutual influence, this article describes them with a fuzzy cognitive map. Finally, the authors identify appropriated policies to enhance the OI adoption and, consequently, the sustainability of innovation in the P&E sector. A salient research agenda closes the paper.

Due to the growing trend of environmental innovation in Greece and a consequent increase in the research interest, this paper fills the existing gap in the relevant literature as there is not enough evidence concerning Greek firms’ environmental innovation practices. To meet the research goal, a questionnaire was distributed to 892 medium and large-sized firms operating in Greece; 225 questionnaires were finally responded. The data is based on firms’ self-assessment concerning environmental innovation and competitive advantage and are analyzed using both descriptive and inductive statistics, including principal components analysis and multiple linear regression. The research results show that the examined firms implement environmental innovation practices at a moderate level. The most common practices of environmental innovation are the implementation of ISO 14001 management systems and the toxic substances usage reduction. The percentage of ISO 14001 implementation is increased compared to the previous years. Furthermore, the regression analysis revealed that the components concerning environmental process innovation and environmental product innovation have a positive impact on the examined firms’ competitive capability. The relationship between Open Innovation and environmental innovation and the contribution of Open Innovation dynamics are discussed as well.

Through the 4th Industrial Revolution technology, the advantages of Smart City are estimated to overcome the city's expenses with city platformization. While a city traditionally is the subject of creation and not consumption, a Smart City currently is the key industry in generating more than 60% of its GDP in value creation from a production viewpoint. Moreover, with the expansion of online-offline convergence, cities can grow without limitation on its size, where connectivity and innovation determine the inclination of the city's benefit-cost curve. As a city platform is responsible for connectivity, its value drastically increases through the 4th Industrial Revolution's O2O (online to offline convergence) platform. When a city reflects on its own as a Digital Twin in the Cloud and when complete information becomes accessible through citizen's participation through smartphones (Edge), Self-organization takes place, an ideal linkage between the city and citizens.

507,"The purpose of the paper is to examine the performance of firms in Peru in relation to entrepreneurial orientation and involvement in Open Innovation. Data were acquired through a survey of middle and senior managers employed in Peruvian companies. Firms achieving higher sales growth did not exhibit more of an entrepreneurial orientation or utilize a double loop learning style. More entrepreneurial firms appear to have adopted a double loop learning approach to knowledge acquisition. Peruvian firms involved in Open Innovation reported higher sales growth and indicated greater reliance on the use of double loop learning. The practical implications of the study are that firms in emerging economies do not have to be reliant on entrepreneurial behaviour to sustain business growth. Nevertheless involvement in Open Innovation can be beneficial. The originality of this paper is that although the results are only for companies in Peru, the findings may suggest that firms operating in emerging economies need not necessarily rely on entrepreneurial behaviour to sustain business growth, although involvement in Open Innovation may enhance business performance.

The results show that the depth of collaboration with different partners (academic/consultants, value chain partners, competitors and firms in other industries) is positively related to innovation performance, whereas the number of different partners and size have negative effects. The main result is that the knowledge content of the collaboration moderates the performance outcomes and the negative impact of having too many different kinds of partners. This illustrates how successful firms use selective collaboration strategies characterized by linking explorative and exploitative knowledge content to specific partners, to leverage the benefits and limit the costs of knowledge boundary crossing processes.

510,"The purpose of this article is to investigate how innovation networks can be used to deal with a changing technological environment. This study combines different concepts related to research and development (R&D) collaboration strategies of large firms and applies these concepts to R&D alliance projects undertaken by Nokia Corporation in the period 1985-2002. The research methodology is a combination of in-depth semistructured interviews and a large-scale quantitative analysis of alliance agreements. For the empirical analysis a distinction is made between exploration and exploitation in innovation networks in terms of three different measures. As a first measure, the difference between exploration and exploitation strategies by means of the observed capabilities of the partners of the contracting firms is investigated. The second measure is related to partner turnover. The present article argues that in exploration networks partner turnover will be higher than in exploitation networks. As a third measure, the type of alliance contract will be taken; exploration networks will make use of flexible legal organizational structures, whereas exploitation alliances are associated with legal structures that enable long-term collaboration. The case of Nokia has illustrated the importance of strategic technology networks for strategic repositioning under conditions of change. Nokia followed an exploitation strategy in the development of the first two generations of mobile telephony and an exploration strategy in the development of technologies for the third generation. Such interfirm networks seem to offer flexibility, speed, innovation, and the ability to adjust smoothly to changing market conditions and new strategic opportunities. These two different strategies have led to distinctly different international innovation networks, have helped the company in becoming a world leader in the mobile phone industry, and have enabled it to sustain that position in a radically changed technological environment. This study also illustrates that Nokia effectively uses an Open Innovation strategy in the development of new products and services and in setting technology standards for current and future use of mobile communication applications. This article presents one of the first longitudinal studies, which describes the use of innovation networks as a means to adapt swiftly to changing market conditions and strategic change. This study contributes to the emerging, but still inconsistent, literature on explorative and exploitative learning by means of strategic technology networks.

513,"The purpose of this paper is to understand to what extent Open Innovation is utilized in R&D departments by using patents as a main source. The paper adopts the “designation of the inventor” as a new method for detecting open or closed innovation, a method which examines the type of relationship that exists between the inventor(s) and the patent applicant(s). Since the openness or closedness of an invention is mainly measured by analyzing a firm’s co-applicants, the patent’s designation of the inventor indicates whether or not inventors are employees of the applicant. The paper offers new empirical evidence about whether a patent is open or not without surveying inventors and it complements previous studies that failed to describe whether a patent is based on open or closed innovation. After studying a collection of 231 patents in the wind energy sector obtained from the European Patent database, descriptive statistics show that OI Patents (OIPs) where the inventor is under agreement represent approximately 90% of the total number of OIPs, which in turn account for more than 23% of the total number of closed and open types of patent. Additionally, the designation of inventor method is also able to identify closed innovation-based patents. The results also show that a minority of companies utilize a hybrid type of OI, in which the inventors are composed of a mix of external individuals and employees. The results suggest that the method proposed yields a better understanding of how OI as well as other innovation strategies are utilized by firms in a particular industry or technological field.

The dynamics of OIES occurs from the positive interaction among the Open Innovation economy, closed innovation economy, and social innovation economy. The dynamics of the OIES circle are from an Open Innovation economy, through a closed innovation economy and social innovation economy, and back to an Open Innovation economy again. In addition, the validation of the model for the dynamics of OIES is improved by simulating the life cycle of the dynamics of OIES, low-level OIES dynamics, and high-level OIES dynamics, and by inquiring about a practical economic system corresponding to each simulation situation. Next through a comparative discussion between the linear steps of Schumpeter 1 and 2, and Socialist Democracy, and the dynamics of an Open Innovation economic system, the practical and theoretical characteristics of the dynamics of OIES are clearly defined.

The results show that companies in the manufacturing sector have a greater propensity to pay dividends compared to those in non-manufacturing sectors. The results also indicate that low institutional ownership, as an external monitoring mechanism, can substitute for increasing the propensity to pay dividends. Overall, the results are consistent with implications in dividend policy. The results support the notion that the propensity to pay dividends accommodates different behavioral factors, considering sectoral differences.

As a consequence, the model for training and managing scientific personnel tends to change. This model, as it moves away from the prevailing pattern adopted by firms in Anglophone countries, is continually drawing closer, even from a cultural standpoint, to the R&D management approach found in the Japanese and German companies. The aim of this article is to investigate how the adoption of Open Innovation has changed the organizational structures of R&D and altered the methods used in managing its personnel. The results of the study are based on the analysis of four case studies of Italian multinational firms operating in the pharmaceutical, food, specialty chemical, and aerospace industries.

529,"The study of Open Innovation has primarily focused on the benefits and consequences of inbound or outbound innovation exchange between firms; however, increasingly firms may be engaged in simultaneous inbound and outbound exchange forming a ""coupled"" approach. Furthermore, firms increasingly collaborate with communities as sources of innovation, but how does such ""communitycoupled Open Innovation"" affect a firm? Through an in-depth study of 250 firms collaborating with a leading open source software community, we show how this approach incorporates not only the exchange of intellectual property but also the provision of help. We find that while community-coupled Open Innovation does not affect productivity, it can expand a firm's social ties, lead to a more conservative strategic posture, and shift its innovation focus. Implications for our theories of Open Innovation in the context of communities are discussed. ",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.032,0.063,0.0,-0.008,0.04,-0.055
530,"The success of Open Innovation as a new paradigm to enhance innovation development has brought public authorities to incentivize firms to collaborate with external organisations. Such incentive is often provided in the form of public subsidies to research and development activities. Some studies observed that public subsidies are generally successful in pursuing the goal of promoting Open Innovation. Nevertheless, as the number of partners increases, the positive effect of collaboration on innovation performance is likely to decrease due to over-search and over-collaboration issues. In this perspective, a mere increase of the firms' propensity to collaborate should not satisfy public authorities, which instead should carefully monitor how public subsidies can improve the efficiency of such collaborations. This article advances the literature about the relationship between public subsidies and Open Innovation by assessing how funds provided by local, national and European authorities are associated with Open Innovation efficiency. By analysing an extensive sample of 43,230 European firms, this study confirms that the three typologies of public subsidies are associated with collaboration in beneficiaries. Furthermore, the study shows that local and national subsidies are also associated with Open Innovation efficiency, whereas European subsidies are not statistically significantly associated with it. This study provides theoretical and policy implications. In a theoretical perspective, it introduces the concept of Open Innovation efficiency, it analyses its public policy drivers and presents several recommendations for future research. In a policy perspective, it suggests explanations for the results obtained and advises policy initiatives to foster Open Innovation efficiency.

531,"The technological catch-up behaviour of latecomer firms has been a topic of interest for the past three decades, especially in emerging economies, such as China and India. However, little research has systematically discussed the capability-upgrading issue that firms face in the context of Open Innovation, and the previous work lacks an explanation for why some Chinese firms can win competitive advantages in the global market within a short time. This study develops a PDSE (Position-Depth-Scope-Efficiency) framework of systemic catch-up to explain the process and mechanism of capability upgrading by using the literature on technological catch-up, Open Innovation, and the capability reconfiguration view. We conduct a multiple-case study based on three top home appliance manufacturers in China– Haier Group, Midea Group, and Gree Electronics. The results show that firms can achieve better positions, depth, and scope of catch-up with higher efficiency in the Open Innovation era. The process of systemic catch-up moves from component capability to architectural capability and then to systemic capability, while four mechanisms based on market and technology reconfigurations are effective in promoting capability upgrading. Overall, a key contribution of this paper is the offering of a new conceptual framework of systemic catch-up to outline the changes in the capability-upgrading process over time. This framework adds to the previous research that is mainly limited to the entry and gradual catch-up stages of capability development and deepens the understanding of the competitiveness of emerging economy firms beyond cost and scale advantages.

533,"The topic of consumer behavior in a social context is important due to its influence on the behaviors and attitudes of individuals. New online business models are adopting Open Innovation practices focused on improving their sales channels through their technological capacity. In this paper, we analyze the purchase intentions in a business context to identify consumer needs through the proper purchase decision process. We must also observe the internal and external factors that influence consumer behavior. More exactly, electronic commerce is facing challenges and opportunities manifested by online consumers, such as design, security, trust, risk, uncertainty, and satisfaction with online purchases. Many external factors (economic, political, social, environmental, and health) influence buyers’ intentions and behaviors. The objectives of this study are to (1) determine the influence of the security level of websites on purchasing behaviors (socially responsible and panic buyers), (2) determine the effect of website security on consumer satisfaction, (3) determine the effect of buyers (socially responsible and panic buyers) on the level of satisfaction, and (4) examine if the buyer experience has a moderating effect between the variables (socially responsible and panic buyers) and the dependent variable (customer satisfaction). We focus on a sample of 663 socially responsible online buyers and panic buyers from the Sonora, Baja California, and Sinaloa regions in Mexico. Data were collected from the months of April to August 2020, and an online questionnaire was used address to each of the residents of these regions aged between 20 and 55 and who were economically active. The data were analyzed using the structural equation model-partial least squares (SEM-PLS) model based on variance. The findings show that website security has significant positive effects on socially responsible buyers, panic buyers, and the level of customer satisfaction. Socially responsible buyers also have positive effects on customer satisfaction. However, the relationship between panic buyers and customer satisfaction is not supported. Related to a moderation analysis, that the buyer experience has a significant effect on the relationship between socially responsible online buyers and the level of satisfaction. Conversely, we find empirical evidence of the buyer experience having no significant effect between panic buyers and customer satisfaction. Our findings contribute to the development of various theories: the theory of behavioral reasoning (BRT), social identity theory (SIT), and the technological adaptation model (TAM). From an academic point of view, the findings are positive and encouraging, contributing to the literature on the e-commerce, behaviors, and attitudes of purchase intentions of individuals. Our work is incorporated into the existing literature on purchase intention and virtual business models, whose characteristics need to continue to be outlined, constituting a popular business model in recent years.

However, socio-economic research on the transition towards the bioeconomy at the firm-level remains scarce. Specifically, studies approaching the bioeconomy from the technology and innovation management (TIM) concepts are particularly uncommon, although the importance of knowledge generation and innovation is considered crucial to make the transition towards a greener economy. In this study, we take a first step in addressing this issue by developing a set of guiding principles for the management of innovation processes in the bioeconomy comprised in three key issues: the relevant stakeholder groups and their importance in innovation development within the bioeconomy, the innovation network strategy and management, and organizational features considered prerequisites for collaborative innovation. This called for an identification of influencing factors specific to the bioeconomy context and the establishment of basic characteristics of innovation processes in the bioeconomy. The five identified influencing factors, the basic innovation process characteristics, and the guidelines and recommendations presented in this paper are based on insights derived from a four-staged literature research of the bioeconomy and TIM literature. In particular, we focused on the Open Innovation approach because of the evident fit between this approach and the requirements for innovation in the bioeconomy.

Identifying these various barriers and understanding their interrelationships would provide a better understanding of the complex nature of the UTT process, which may be considered as inputs to crucial decision-making initiatives. This paper addresses this gap by holistically determining UTT barriers and their intertwined relationships. Using the Delphi method and fuzzy cognitive mapping, a case study in a state university in the Philippines was conducted to carry out this objective. The Delphi process extracts 24 relevant barriers of UTT, out of 46 barriers obtained from a comprehensive review of the extant literature. The results show that misalignment between research and commercialization objectives is the barrier that was influenced most by the other barriers. In contrast, high costs of managing joint research projects in terms of time and money and institutional bureaucracy have the highest out-degree measures or are the barriers that influence other barriers the most. These findings provide guidelines to various stakeholders and decision-makers in understanding the existence of barriers in the formulation of strategies and initiatives for a successful UTT process.

However, the “human side” of Open Innovation is still poorly understood. We consider the role of employee characteristics with respect to predicting firm-level openness. Drawing on the human capital, learning and creativity literatures, we theorize that knowledge diversity of the firm's employees is positively associated with employees’ ability to identify and absorb external knowledge, which aggregates to increased firm-level openness—that is, firms’ use of external knowledge in their pursuit of innovation. Based on a combination of three data sources, namely, two survey data sources and register data, we find support for our hypothesis that employees’ educational diversity is positively associated with firm-level openness. However, we find no direct association between employees’ work history diversity and firm-level openness but rather—as also hypothesized—a conditional relationship based on educational background, which implies that diverse work history only has a positive impact at higher levels of educational diversity. To reduce endogeneity concerns, we undertake a series of robustness checks. ",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.05,0.072,-0.013,0.063,0.005,-0.027

544,"There exists a huge amount of literature with regard to the new openness of firms or universities to trigger innovations. Among others the Triple-Helix approach conceptualizes the role of the state to fulfill the demand of social welfare. The state, universities and private companies together fulfill different values und function according to different rules of the game. In fact, the state disposes of the monopoly of power. Therefore, it is of interest to further elaborate the question of how the state should fulfill its role within this interplay. The purpose of the following paper is therefore to reveal firstly a corresponding research gap and to formulate an answer by referring to organizational formats. By means of a theoretically derived concept according to plausibility considerations the superiority of a network over a hierarchy governmental approach is proclaimed. Secondly, the paper highlights the new demanding and conflicting role of universities with regard to the collaboration with private business companies. Universities as a knowledge supplier fulfil a crucial role within this institutional framework and need to redefine their self-understanding as collaboration with business gains importance. Thirdly Web 2.0 applications within the framework of lifelong learning concepts are being discussed as an adequate tool to fulfil the requirements developed earlier on: The question arises in what way innovative technologies and blended learning can support learning by business people on the one hand and adapt research work of university people to the realistic demands of business on the other. In conclusion some policy implications are derived from this conceptual paper, focusing on the role of intermediary agents and innovative technologies to enhance trust relationships between the different stakeholders and seeking to add useful considerations with regard to innovation policy. The main findings deny a restrictive policy approach. Instead, rather a concept in the sense of help for self-help seems to be fruitful. By means of organizing the innovation policy throughout a sense of ""Openness"" towards all relevant stakeholders the impetus lies on strengthening the system from the inside.

545,"There has been a paradigm shift to a knowledge-oriented economy in the 21st century. Consequently, there has also been a shift in where innovation typically occurs. This shift has been from the production site toward the process of product diffusion. That is, innovation occurs more frequently at the point at which a product or service is moved into the marketplace where it is immediately modified through customer interaction. In this process, new ""functionality"" - services, the delivery method or even product changes occur in the diffusion process. Given the need to constantly create new value through new product ""functionality"" or new ""functionality development"", firm strategy must address the issue of how to enhance innovation at this new locus - the diffusion process. Sustainable new functionality development over time has become crucial to a firm's competitiveness. In this context, firms have to develop new functionality as early and quickly as possible; leveraging whatever innovation exists in the marketplace. According to theory, the early emergence of functionality development in this context depends on a dynamic system in which the imitator (follower) is constantly substituting for the innovator (leader). This substitution corresponds to the dynamics observed in the process referred to as ""Open Innovation"". According to this theory, functionality development through follower substitution for a leader would be critical for a firm's competitiveness in the Open Innovation environment. Furthermore, Open Innovation could be a process for sustaining the ongoing creation of new value through functionality development maximizing limited resources. This paper attempts to demonstrate this hypothesis through an empirical analysis of this process of substitution in major innovative goods and services in Japan.

The authors considered the principal theoretical concepts on which the study of trust, the well-being of citizens, the assessment of security and compliance with the fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens is to be based. It is assumed that the legitimacy of the social order consists in a state where people not only trust specific institutions, but also enjoy a sense of security from threats and the ability to exercise basic rights and freedoms in the presence of a competent authority to protect them in case of violations. The dynamics of the security of the inhabitants of the region, associated with an increase in the level of their well-being, are considered. The structure for retaining the legitimacy of the social order is demonstrated on the basis of a number of indices and model calculations. Configuration analysis was carried out to support the construction of multidimensional models. It was concluded that there has been a dramatic collapse in the social activity of the inhabitants of the Arctic region bordering on social apathy. It is shown that, during the period under study, trust in local authorities significantly declined, while the importance attributed to respecting private property rights increased. Trust in social institutions is shown to be significantly lower than trust in government institutions, contradicting the situation in developed countries. It is recommended that more attention be paid to the functioning of local and municipal authorities governing the Arctic region, who are much more aware of the needs of the inhabitants since they are connected by much denser social ties.

Findings indicate that the use of Open APIs has accelerated R&D through knowledge-sharing with web developers; generated new means of commercializing content by extending a firm's product portfolio; and forged innovation networks that function as external R&D departments.

560,"This article examines the role of social relations and networks in Open Innovation settings. Building on extant Open Innovation literature as well as on social capital theory, we develop a model that conceptualizes social capital as a mediator between the implementation of Open Innovation instruments and firm performance. In doing so, this paper adds to the understanding of the role of structure and content of social relations in Open Innovation contexts as well as of sustainable side-effects of Open Innovation. In particular, we argue that apart from a direct effect of Open Innovation instruments on firm performance, there is also a mediated relationship between these variables. More precisely, we propose that the implementation of Open Innovation instruments strengthens an organization's social capital, which is, in turn, positively related to firm performance. s",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.028,0.032,0.004,-0.019,-0.031,-0.033

The study integrates effectuation theory with an Open Innovation strategy within the platform ecosystem to understand the innovation process under resource constraint, limited knowledge, and uncertainty. Our inductive multiple-case study findings from three leading digital MSP startups show how their founding team uses the knowledge, ideas, and resources from external parties within the platform ecosystem, including agents, user communities, and supporting partner firms, along with means from the entrepreneurs’ background, in the beginning to produce high growth innovation outcomes. Platform-based entrepreneurship becomes the integrating point of effectuation theory from entrepreneurship research and Open Innovation strategy through strategic management research.

It presents research experience gained from a European project for managing social and technological innovation in the production and evaluation of citizen-centred internet-enabled services in the public sector. It is based on six urban pilot initiatives, which sought to operationalise a new approach to co-producing and co-evaluating civic services in smart cities – commonly referred to as Open Innovation for smart city services. Research suggests that the evidence base underpinning this approach is not sufficiently robust to support claims being made about its effectiveness. Instead evaluation research of citizen-centred internet-enabled urban services is in its infancy and there are no tested methods or tools in the literature for supporting this approach. The paper reports on the development and trialing of a novel Co-evaluation Framework, indicators and reporting categories, used to support the co-production of smart city services in an EU-funded project.

567,"This article uses a contemporary and revelatory case study to explore the relationship between three conversations in the innovation literature: Design Thinking, creativity in strategy, and the emerging area of Art Thinking. Businesses are increasingly operating in a VUCA environment where they need to design better experiences for their customers and better outcomes for their firm and the Arts are no exception. Innovation, or more correctly, growth through innovation, is a top priority for business and although there is no single, unifying blueprint for success at innovation, Design Thinking is the process that is receiving most attention and getting most traction. We review the literature on Design Thinking, showing how it teaches businesses to think with the creativity and intuition of a designer to show a deep understanding of, and have empathy with, the user. However, Design Thinking has limitations. By placing the consumer at the very heart of the innovation process, Design Thinking can often lead to more incremental, rather than radical, ideas. Now there is a new perspective emerging, Art Thinking, in which the objective is not to design a journey from the current scenario, A, to an improved position, A+. Art Thinking requires the creation of an optimal position B, and spends more time in the open-ended problem space, staking out possibilities and looking for uncontested space.

This setting is one of changing knowledge production regimes and institutional pressures that create contradictions identifiable through the prism of the series of scientific norms conceptualised by Robert K. Merton. This paper privileges a sociological perspective to proffer scientific knowledge production as a societally embedded process, which is well illustrated by scholarship in the Science and Technology Studies (STS) and Science in Society fields. In doing so, it identifies the co-evolution, co-existence and co-production of Open Science with Open Innovation; and notes how it shares the attributes of other recent diagnoses of changing knowledge production regimes; in particular Mode 2, post-normal science and the Quadruple Helix. It also argues that Open Science can be coupled with Open Innovation to catalyse positive societal change, but that the rise of a populist post-truth era opposed to objectivity, expertise and technocratic political solutions gives the demand for openness and participation a different complexion. Merton's norms provide a useful lens to observe recent shifts in the delivery of science, knowledge and innovation in society towards more inclusive, ethical and sustainable outcomes; and expose the limited reflection on how the appropriation and exploitation of open scientific knowledge encounters industrial R&D and Open Innovation.",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.024,-0.016,-0.036,0.071,0.006,0.03

Some forms of activity, in particular intellectual property protection through patenting, are found to be negatively associated with centrality. Spatial location is largely found to be unrelated to the network centrality of universities.

583,"This paper builds new theory and provides supporting evidence to contain the Not-Invented-Here Syndrome (NIHS) – a persistent decision-making error arising from an attitude-based bias against external knowledge. Conceptually, we draw on the 4i framework of organizational learning to develop a novel process perspective on NIHS. This allows us not only to unpack how and where NIHS impedes organizational learning, but also to identify the key requirements for effective NIHS countermeasures. Importantly, countermeasures fall into two categories: those that seek to change the negative attitude directly (direct NIHS countermeasures) and those that seek to attenuate the behavioral impact of negative attitudes without addressing the attitudes as such (indirect NIHS countermeasures). While the evidence base on direct NIHS countermeasures has grown over the last decade, indirect NIHS countermeasures have received little research attention. To address this gap, we adopt a mixed methods research design composed of two complementary empirical studies – the first qualitative and the second quantitative. Study 1 explores the prevalence of distinct NIHS countermeasures in collaborative R&D practice. Based on 32 interviews and three focus group meetings with R&D employees, we find that a broad array of primarily direct NIHS countermeasures is employed in R&D practice. Study 2 addresses the scarcity of scholarly and managerial insights on indirect NIHS countermeasures by testing the effectiveness of perspective taking as a debiasing technique to contain negative attitudes at the level of the individual. Based on quantitative survey data from 565 global R&D projects, it provides empirical evidence not only for the prevalence and negative effects of NIHS on project success as mediated by external knowledge absorption, but also for the effectiveness of perspective taking as an exemplary indirect NIHS countermeasure.

I explain the novelty of Open Innovation, its genealogy, and the implications for people and conditions of work as much as for firms in a new topology of power relations. I cast the ensemble of strategies and tactics encompassed in Open Innovation as contingent, continually unfolding, and sometimes chaotic if not destructive for both firms and labor, in contrast to the celebratory tone in the business as well as geography and regional studies literatures regarding its benefits for competitiveness, innovativeness, value capture, and development. Open Innovation – the externalization of innovation – entails long-run approaches to innovation and investment that are fraught with problems, prompting the development of short-term tactics to engage the challenges. One short-run strategy, crowdsourcing, bypasses the conventional web of inter-firm relations to connect digitally with individuals of the global crowd, enabling firms to reap the benefits of the crowd's innovative talents, often without remuneration under circumstances that institutionalize informal work. These neoliberal subjects are best understood in terms of multiple subjectivities. I close by connecting the crowdsourcing of innovative with non-innovative work, both of which are parts of the emergent regime associated with new hiring and work practices that usher in new modes of exploitation.

The dynamic consequences of OI, for both OS and PL, are studied using a complex adaptive systems approach. We examine how profits, technology levels, R&D investment, technology adoption and market structure evolve under each and are impacted by underlying market characteristics. While both OS and PL are found to be equivalent in technology outcomes, OS comes with additional advantages to participating firms. Firms in the OS framework earn higher profit and are more efficient with their R&D investments. The industry is less concentrated under OS than under PL, except when market size is very large. In both frameworks, consumer preference for new product adoption has a significant impact. When consumers adopt newly introduced products relatively quickly, market concentration is the higher and overall rate of technological progress slower.

Open Innovation has become crucial for an increasing number of multinational enterprises (MNEs) to gain and maintain competitive advantage and become a market leader. Despite the recent proliferation of papers dealing with Open Innovation practices of MNEs, there is limited work investigating the role of knowledge management (KM) capability on the relationship between knowledge-oriented leadership and Open Innovation. Given MNEs’ growing interest in Open Innovation, the lack of research on knowledge-oriented leadership and KM capability in the Open Innovation context is a significant research gap in our knowledge. In response, we conducted a study on the mediating role of KM capability in the linkage between knowledge-oriented leadership and Open Innovation (inbound and outbound), using data collected from 172 subsidiaries of MNEs based in France. A structural equation modelling approach is employed to study the impact of the latent variables associated with knowledge-oriented leadership and KM capability on Open Innovation. The results indicate that higher levels of knowledge-oriented leadership can lead to enhanced KM capability and improved Open Innovation outcomes. That is, knowledge-oriented leadership has a direct, positive impact on KM capability and Open Innovation. Also, KM capability is found to mediate the linkage between knowledge-oriented leadership and Open Innovation. This study provides useful insights for managers who wish to enhance Open Innovation activities in MNEs, and offers useful guidance to international business scholars, encouraging further research in this area.

591,"This paper examines the concept of Open Innovation within the context of corporate social responsibility. It demonstrates how the practice of Open Innovation unfolds in inter-organizational collaborations that involve the voluntary or charitable sector, outlining the findings of an explorative collective case study of eight voluntary dyadic partnerships between corporate and nonprofit organizations in the United Kingdom, which have resulted in innovation outcomes. Two generic approaches to Open Innovation were witnessed: firstly, a more exploratory approach to dyadic engagement activities that resulted in an emergent innovation process, and secondly, a focused and pre-determined search activity to exploit the resources of the nonprofit partner that demonstrated a more planned innovation process. Two distinct boundary-spanning roles were identified: in dyads exhibiting few organizational linkages, the role was associated with formal responsibilities from senior management to 'manage' innovation opportunities and outcomes. In dyads exhibiting high linkages, there was no such formality; the role was a 'conduit' to facilitate search and exploration to locate opportunities for innovation through idea exchange. Overall, this research demonstrates the value of an Open Innovation approach driven by the need to address societal and social issues (rather than those purely economic). Such practice broadens a firm's 'search' activities and delivers innovations in exchange for enhanced social legitimacy - acting innovation capital for future enterprising activities and market advantage.

592,"This paper examines the dynamics of entrepreneurial acquisitions undertaken by UK high growth small and medium enterprises (SMEs). While entrepreneurial acquisitions are increasingly deployed by SMEs, little is known about their antecedents, motivational drivers and organisational outcomes. Drawing on detailed case study evidence from Scotland, the key factor found to be driving these acquisitions was the desire to augment and exploit technological complementarities between the acquiring and acquired firms. Acquisition can therefore be conceptualised as an advanced stage of the outside-in ‘Open Innovation’ strategies proactively used within these innovative SMEs. Firms executing this strategy typically have an acute propensity for risk, a desire for close customer engagement, effective business models and strong external orientation. The work suggests that greater attention should be paid within M&A theory to the dynamics of these types of smaller scale entrepreneurial acquisitions.

593,"This paper examines the relationship between (outside-in) Open Innovation and the financial performance of R&D projects, drawing on a unique dataset that contains information on the Open Innovation practices, management and performance of 489 R&D projects of a large European multinational firm. We introduce two types of Open Innovation partnerships - science-based and market-based partnerships - and examine their relationships with project financial performance. In addition, we investigate whether the Open Innovation - project performance relationships are influenced by the way how R&D projects are managed. Our results show that R&D projects with Open Innovation partnerships are associated with a better financial performance providing that they are managed in the most suitable way. Market-based partnerships are positively correlated with project performance if a formal project management process is used; however these partnerships are associated with a lower performance for loosely managed projects. In contrast, science-based partnerships are associated with higher project revenues for loosely managed projects only. ",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.035,0.008,0.005,-0.036,-0.112,-0.02

Specifically, it invokes a dynamic capabilities perspective to propose the differential moderating effects of two forms of reconfiguration capabilities, strategic reconfiguration capability (SRC) and operational reconfiguration capability (ORC), on the focal relationship. Based on a sample of service sector firms drawn from the UK Community Innovation Survey, our analysis shows the positive combinative effects of SRC and coupled OI on radical innovation outcomes and those of ORC and coupled OI on incremental innovation outcomes. The findings of differential moderating effects underscore the need to assess the boundary conditions within which OI positively impacts on innovation outcomes and offer insights to managers on the importance of strategic and operational reconfiguration capabilities for achieving better innovation outcomes from OI practices.

In doing so, it offers new insights into the association between Open Innovation and diversification. We rely on arguments inspired by the literature and evidence collected through interviews with OSS SMEs' top managers to investigate factors that favor or hinder within-industry diversification. First, in line with the mainstream diversification literature, we focus attention on the role of firm size. Second, in the spirit of the Open Innovation research, we concentrate on the mechanisms that OSS SMEs put in place to get access to the external resources of the OSS community. Econometric evidence on 100 European OSS SMEs shows that firm size is negatively associated to within-industry diversification, while OSS SMEs that have contributed to a larger number of OSS projects have a more diversified portfolio of software products. Furthermore, we provide preliminary evidence that the practice of authorizing firm programmers to contribute autonomously to OSS projects of their own choice during working hours may be positively associated to within-industry diversification only if OSS SMEs possess adequate internal technological resources.

We argue that network positions provide the information content to the firm, whilst Open Innovation flow describes how the firm uses such content, thus the combination of these two concepts has a significant impact on new product development. We test the theoretical framework on a large sample of 544 public companies and data from 1758 agreements among 1890 bio-pharmaceutical firms through the period 2006-2010. Our results show that being centrally located in the network positively affects the new product development process, while having a structural holes position has no effect on the aforementioned performance. However, the interaction of the two network positions with the Open Innovation flow has a positive impact on the likelihood to develop new products.

Second, redundancy has twofold elements: institutional logics redundancy triggers cultural change challenges which can be overcome through management practices and communications; task redundancy facilitates knowledge sharing and collaboration, thus helping to deal with organisational change challenges. Finally, loose coupling in OI settings facilitates social interconnectedness among members through management practices, helping to face organisational and cultural change challenges.

We examine how a major oil and gas producer fostered, through its internal corporate venture unit, the development of new technologies aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of the oilfield services offered by its key providers. The comparative analysis of five innovative projects suggests that two factors were critical for the successful deployment of the proposed technologies: their potential to broaden service providers’ portfolios and the possibility to retain control over the relevant intellectual property. The concurrent presence of these two factors incentivized service providers to deploy the new technologies, aligning their interests with those of the oil major company. By revealing unexplored aspects of the interplay of inter-firm collaborations and Open Innovation processes, this paper extends our understanding of how firms can align the incentives and activities of other actors in their business ecosystems by strategizing their Open Innovation initiatives.

In this context, systems integrators are firms that integrate component innovations into existing product systems and that design entirely new product architectures. To successfully execute these systems integration tasks, these firms need to monitor and absorb the rapid and diverse technological developments that surround them. Systems integration therefore explains why firms know more than they make. Open Innovation, on its part, provides the mechanisms that indicate how firms can expand their knowledge boundary. Open Innovation and systems integration are strong complements therefore. More specifically, a contingent and a balanced approach to Open Innovation is suggested: open as far as abundant component knowledge is concerned, and closed with respect to the generation and exploitation of scarce, internally developed architectural knowledge.

Drawing from the corporate strategy and Open Innovation literature, we argued that SMEs with state and foreign ownership can more effectively capture economic rents from Open Innovation in a weak intellectual-property-rights regime. Meanwhile, the subnational environments in which SMEs locate their businesses is also crucial for them to capture value from Open Innovation. Using the data of 1050 SMEs in China, we found that state ownership positively and significantly moderates the relationship between openness and innovative performance, while foreign ownership partially supports the same effect. By disentangling the pro-business environment and the market development, we found that for SMEs that are located in a region with a stronger pro-business environment and a higher level of market development, Open Innovation can bring more value than it does for those located in regions with lower levels of those factors.

In particular, it explores the relationship between the openness of innovation process through innovation networks and the development of organisational structures within firms, as well as its linkage to a regional sectoral environment. It proposes a new conceptual tool of “innovation moments”, to synthesise the key theoretical premises of knowledge management, organisational learning and absorptive capacity literatures. In order to study this vital nexus of phenomena, we propose to deploy a novel mixed methods approach of combining quantitative ego-centric Social Network Analysis (Ego-SNA) and qualitative derived narratives of product development experiences via a sensitising concept, to study the emergence and development of the New Space Sector in Scotland. The findings show that the type of the SME – “traditional” versus New Space and upstream versus downstream – is clearly related to the structure of the firms' ego-centric innovation networks and their position in the composite whole network. Furthermore, by using qualitative case study data we show that the firms' typology is also closely related to internal organisational features, in particular flattening hierarchical structures and the formalisation and standardisation within NPD processes. This paper argues that the interlinking of these two elements is poised to describe a cultural shift in the approach to innovation networking and new product development (NPD) process management, understanding of which is a critical element of examining Open Innovation in SMEs.

615,"This paper proposes to review and assess social scientific debate about the origins and nature of innovation in modern society. It focuses on three sub-sets of conceptualisation, critique and commentary that refer specifically to sub-national or regional innovation systems. Research in the latter field has grown enormously in recent years. Moreover, new perspectives from other disciplines than regional science have been promoted. One distinctive view of relevance in that it is focused on the role in innovation of specific 'entrepreneurial universities' in relation to industry and government is, of course, the 'Triple Helix' approach. This is reviewed and sympathetically critiqued. A second view, less sympathetically critiqued here, is one that itself attacks all so-called 'new regionalism' for stressing the importance of institutions, industry embeddedness and the micro-science of regional economic development. Dazzled by 'Globalisation 1' and the totalising power of 'scale' geographies, this rejection of the worth of spatial analysis at less than the global or national 'scalar envelope' is assessed for its potential insights into weaknesses of the regional innovation systems approach but found wanting in both technical accuracy and scholarly competence. Finally, the state of the art in regional innovation systems research is sketched by reference both to recent longitudinal findings and elaborations into specific technological fields, particularly but not only Bioregional Innovation Systems that help move us towards a newer theory of economic geography in the knowledge economy, based on 'regional knowledge capabilities.' The analysis conclusively proposes 'Globalisation 2', a 'ground-up' knowledge-driven evolution of the earlier 'top-down' multilateral trade institution and corporately driven 'Globalisation 1.'

616,"This paper provides a quantitative study (N = 268) of patterns of free revealing of firm-developed innovations within embedded Linux, a type of open source software (OSS). I find that firms, without being obliged to do so, contribute many of their own developments back to public embedded Linux code, eliciting and indeed receiving informal development support from other firms. That is, they perform a part of their product development open to the public-an unthinkable idea for traditionally minded managers. Such openness obviously entails the challenge of protecting one's intellectual property. I find that firms address this issue by revealing selectively. They reveal, on average, about half of the code they have developed, while protecting the other half by various means. Revealing is strongly heterogeneous among firms. Multivariate analysis can partly explain this heterogeneity by firm characteristics and the firm's purpose behind revealing. An analysis of reasons for revealing and of the type of revealed code shows that different types of firms have different rationales for openness. Implications for management are that the conflict between downsides and benefits of openness appears manageable. Provided selective revealing is practiced deliberately, the opportunities of open development dominate. ",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.042,0.075,0.004,-0.019,0.067,-0.072

More specifically, ROIR is a tool to promote sustainable regional development that integrates ""Open Innovation"" elements in technology roadmapping. We applied this approach to the introduction of the innovative building-related urban agriculture subtype known as ""Zero-acreage farming"" (ZFarming) to the Berlin metropolitan area. ZFarming includes rooftop gardens, rooftop greenhouses, edible green walls, indoor farms and/or vertical greenhouses. Thus, the ROIR approach was applied between 2011 and 2013 to define sustainable development options for ZFarming in Berlin, specifically aiming both to find possible ZFarming models for Berlin and to develop guidelines for their sustainable implementation. During the participatory process, approximately 50 contributors established a stakeholder network and jointly defined a roadmap to enable administrators, politicians, citizens and practitioners to effectively address ZFarming. An ex-post evaluation was conducted in 2014 via an online survey to estimate the effects of the ROIR approach on (a) knowledge generation, (b) new stakeholder network establishment, (c) new project implementation and (d) the general perception of ZFarming. The results revealed that the ROIR process stimulated the establishment of new networks and alliances, contributed to knowledge generation and created a common understanding for the future implementation of ZFarming among diverse stakeholders.

623,"This research addresses a specific issue in the field of operation scheduling. Even though there are lots of researches on the field of planning and scheduling, a specific scheduling problem is introduced here. We focus on the operation scheduling requirements that the Fourth Industrial Revolution has brought currently. From the point of view of Open Innovation, operation scheduling is known as the one that is using the Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, Big Data, and Mobile technology. To build proper operation systems under the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it is very essential to devise effective and efficient scheduling methodology to improve product quality, customer delivery, manufacturing flexibility, cost saving, and market competence. A scheduling problem on designated parallel equipments, where some equipments are grouped according to the recipe of lots, is considered. This implies that a lot associated with a specific recipe is preferred to be processed on an equipment among predetermined (designated) ones regardless of parallel ones.

624,"This research examines the performance of the Islamic stock portfolio (ISP) and conventional stock portfolio (CSP) for the five industrial sectors and market in Malaysia. The capital asset pricing model statistics indicate that the ISP provides a higher return with a lower systematic risk compared to the CSP in different sectors; however, the ISP and CSP perform equally in the market. The non-parametric stochastic dominance approach reveals that the ISP is better than the CSP for portfolio return without considering the riskiness for all sectors except properties; further, the ISP outperforms the CSP under the market condition. Economic significance analysis identifies that the expected financial loss of the ISP is lower than that of the CSP in all sectors other than properties; the anticipated financial loss of the ISP is significantly less than that of the CSP in the market situation. The overall findings imply that the risk-sharing ISP is superior to the risk-bearing CSP for better returns at the sector as well as the market level.

625,"This research explores how small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) manage external stakeholders during Open Innovation processes. To date, extensive literature has explored OI within large organisations, however, there is limited understanding of how SMEs can strategically manage stakeholders during different stages of OI projects. Using a multi-grounded theory approach, 11 cases of SME OI projects were analysed across four regions within Europe. The findings reveal a wide range of primary and secondary stakeholders with varying levels of power and dependency were leveraged across the different stages of the OI projects. A model is presented which advances knowledge on how to map, analyse and manage stakeholders strategically in a SME-OI context. Our research helps advance theory on SME-OI stakeholder management processes and reveals appropriate stakeholder management strategies, which will assist SME managers in alleviating the SME-OI paradox.

626,"This research focuses on how the tourism and hospitality industry is applying the paradigm of Open Innovation, supported by social media. Open Innovation has been on the topical research agenda, but the previous literature lacks studies in the service sector and specifically for tourism companies. Moreover, the introduction of social media as a tool to implement Open Innovation is considered the main research gap. Structural equation modelling is applied to data from 181 Portuguese and Spanish companies to study both customer involvement in new product development and the perceptions and results in terms of turnover and competitiveness. The structure of the relationships between research and development, external openness and Open Innovation management is highlighted with statistical analysis. In addition, the introduction of social media adds value to the proposed model. Currently, there is a lack of available models to give structure to the OI paradigm and to allow us to manage it. The contribution of this research is a comparison of the explanatory power of three models that allow us to test how certain strategic guidelines in tourism companies influence each other and have a mediating or multiplier effect when linked to each other (nested models method). In conclusion, the originality of this research is based on the relationship between Open Innovation management and social media and the mediating effect of external openness.

627,"This research is to analyse the existing cooperation between universities and the construction industry and to investigate what is the most effective model for long-term cooperation between an academic university and the private construction sector. The current article describes the human resources management tools to be used by employers to create interrelations between the paid salaries and productivity, thus providing both individual and corporate results. The suggested different tools contribute to keeping employees satisfied and motivated, simultaneously properly balancing productivity and individual earnings. The researchers conclude that it is necessary to create a new model for personnel selection and a new approach to stimulate motivation and maintenance within the construction industry. In order to respond to the needs of the sector for professionals and the required increase of the qualifications of the mentioned specialists, it is necessary that the country improves the level of education of the future professionals for the construction industry and changes the system of testing their professional qualifications, which means cooperation between the educational institutions and the industry.

This question has remained partially unanswered given the challenges encountered by empirical research in assessing the relevance of specific OI practices within the OI model, as well as the types of activities perceived by managers as OI benefits or concerns. To provide an answer to this question, we suggest a framework using Item Response Theory to improve over current measures of firms' openness and test it on a sample of 383 technology-based SMEs. Our theoretical model conceives openness as an instance of how firms make decisions regarding the adoption of different OI practices based on their evaluation of OI benefits and concerns. Focusing on the relationship between firm-level differences in terms of openness and the types of OI practices adopted by these firms, we show that significantly different levels of ‘OI maturity’ are required to broaden the scope of external partnerships and to shift from non-pecuniary OI modes (relation-based approaches) toward pecuniary (transaction-based) practices.

630,"This study addresses the following matters: What is the structure and mechanism of modern capital economic dynamics that motivates the growth limits of capitalism? The modern economy can be modeled as Entrepreneurial Cyclical Dynamics of Open Innovation with three sub-economies such as market Open Innovation by SMEs and start-ups, closed Open Innovation by big business, and social Open Innovation. When there is low balance among the three sub-economies, which is to say, if any of the sub-economies is too big, or too small, the economy dynamics decreases, and the economic growth rate slows down to nearly zero or even negative according to the model simulation. South Korea, with a low internal reserve policy, is in this situation. When there is medium balance among three sub-economies, which is to say, any of the sub-economies is big enough to lead the total economy but is not sufficiently big to control totally the other two economies, the economy dynamics increases and the economic growth rate will be maintained at a high level according to the model simulation. India, with its grassroots innovation festival, demonstrates this situation. When there is a high balance among the three sub-economies, which is to say, the three sub-economies are well balanced and there is no change in the economic system, the economy dynamics become too low and the economic growth rate stays at a low level according to the model simulation.

Further filtering innovations into two categories of proactive and reactive ones, we find that reactive innovation negatively affects firm performance, consistent with the view that proactive entrepreneurial behavior is a highly sought-after characteristic or a valuable resource for a firm as specified in resources-based theory. Finally, our result implies that if firms have low constraint or have sufficient resources, proactive strategies should be the choice if firms seek to improve their performance.

Prior studies have mostly concentrated on ‘internal’ mechanisms, and less attention has been given to how Open Innovation practices can promote OA. Our observation of 214 Iran knowledge-intensive firms indicates that OI, entailing inbound and outbound Open Innovation activities, significantly enhances OA. Yet, contrary to our expectation, EO negatively moderates the relationship between OI and OA in the developing context of Iran.

The findings of this study are as follows: The most preferred alliance strategy of large food firms is joint research. In order to secure raw materials and markets, Open Innovation was actively conducted abroad, which increased growth and profitability. However, a firm which rarely adopts Open Innovation could grow steadily through internal strategies. On the other hand, although relatively many Open Innovations have been used, growth and profitability could decrease.

640,"This study estimates the impact of potential climate change, and human interference (anthropogenic deforestation), on temperate forest carbon pool change in the capital area of South Korea, using a dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM). Additionally, the characteristics of forest carbon pool change were simulated based on a biogeochemical module. The change of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration is deeply related to the change of the forest carbon pool, which is estimated with the measures of Net Primary Productivity (NPP), and Soil Carbon Storage (SCS). NPP and SCS were estimated at 2.02-7.43 tC ha-1 year-1 and 34.55-84.81 tC ha-1, respectively, during the period 1971-2000. SCS showed a significant decreasing tendency under the conditions of increasing air temperature, and precipitation, in the near future (2021-2050), and far future (2071-2100), which were simulated with future-climate scenario data without any human interference. Besides, it is estimated that the temporal change in NPP indicates only a small decrease, which is little influenced by potential climate change. In the case of potential climate change plus human interference, the decrease rate of NPP and SCS were simulated at 17-33% and 21-46%, respectively, during 2000-2100. Furthermore, the effect of potential human interference contributes to 83-93% and 61-54% of the decrease rate of NPP and SCS, respectively. The decline in the forest carbon pool simulated in this study can play a positive role in increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide. Consequently, the effect of potential human interference can further accelerate the decline of the temperate forest carbon pool. For the effective reduction of carbon dioxide emissions in urbanizing areas, it would be more effective to control human interference. Consequently, this study suggests that a rate of reforestation corresponding to the deforestation rate should be at least maintained, with long term monitoring and modeling-related studies, against climate change problems.

Second, IV incorporated information is not relevant to compute the value of options for a horizon of less than a week. Third, IV in the closing period of Monday or Tuesday subsumes most of the essential information to estimate options price.

The balance between radical and incremental innovation is an essential part of the ambidextrous use of explorative and exploitative strategies, and this study assumed that Open Innovation is usually interlinked with explorative strategies and is thus related to radical innovation performance. Accordingly, following an empirical investigation, we demonstrate that the balance of Open Innovation firms is slightly skewed toward explorative radical innovation. Using the Korean version of the community innovation survey, we show that the relative radicalness that is projected on innovation output exhibits an inverted-U curve. Furthermore, the curve shifts based on the level of inbound Open Innovation.

653,"Through an objective, systematic, and comprehensive review of the literature on Open Innovation, this article identifies gaps in existing research, and provides recommendations on how hitherto unused or underused organizational, management, and marketing theories can be applied to advance the field. This study adopts a novel approach by combining two complementary bibliometric methods of co-citation analysis and text mining of 321 journal articles on OI that enables a robust empirical analysis of the intellectual streams and key concepts underpinning OI. Results reveal that researchers do not sufficiently draw on theoretical perspectives external to the field to examine multiple facets of OI. Research also seems confined to innovation-specific journals with its focus restricted to a select few OI issues, thereby exerting limited influence on the wider business community. This study reveals three distinct areas within OI research: (1) firm-centric aspects of OI, (2) management of OI networks, and (3) role of users and communities in OI. Thus far, studies have predominantly investigated the firm-centric aspects of OI, with a particular focus on the role of knowledge, technology, and R&D from the innovating firm's perspective, while the other two areas remain relatively under-researched. Further gaps in the literature emerge that present avenues for future research, namely to: (1) develop a more comprehensive understanding of OI by including diverse perspectives (users, networks, and communities), (2) direct increased attention to OI strategy formulation and implementation, and (3) enhance focus on customer co-creation and conceptualize “open service innovation.” Marketing (e.g., service-dominant logic), organizational behavior (e.g., communities of practice), and management (e.g., dynamic capabilities) offer suitable theoretical lenses and/or concepts to address these gaps.

Depending on the level of partner alignment, different types of OI activities may thrive or fail. Drawing on social network theory, this study investigates how firms should arrange partner alignment to realize the full potential of highly and weakly interactive OI activities and foster firms’ technology and market adaptiveness and, ultimately, innovation success. Using empirical tests on a multi-industry data set gathered from 181 managers, the results show that firms that perform highly interactive OI activities should strive for high partner alignment to enhance their technology and market adaptiveness. In contrast, firms employing weakly interactive OI activities should avoid high partner alignment, as such alignment lowers the positive impact of these OI activities on both technological and market adaptiveness and, in turn, decreases innovation success.

655,"To create value in an Open Innovation context, firms need to increase the permeability of their organizational boundaries to enable knowledge exchange with a broad set of partners. Yet to capture value, firms also need to consider how to govern their cooperative efforts and prevent unintended knowledge leakage. This paper develops a novel framework for researching this paradox of openness, which combines an organizational boundary with a relational contract design perspective. First, we extend prior literature by arguing that value is not created only by optimizing resource bundles through external search processes (i.e., competence boundaries). Instead, value can be created by managing interdependencies with external parties (i.e., power boundaries), aligning Open Innovation activities with the organization's identity (i.e., identity boundaries), and coordinating diverse transactions in an Open Innovation portfolio (i.e., efficiency boundaries). Second, we propose that relational contract design is an important alternative to formal appropriation regimes and discuss how contractual mechanisms derived from a relational perspective can enable value capture in an Open Innovation context. Finally, we discuss how firms can strategically manage configurations of firm boundaries and contract design via a set of dynamic capabilities.

Yet, Open Innovation, referring to innovation practices that cross borders of individual firms, faces constraints. To explore these constraints and identify opportunities, this study performs interviews with government/agency officials and space technology entrepreneurs. The interviews highlight three topic areas with constraints and opportunities: 1) mainly one-directional knowledge flows (from outside the space sector to inside), 2) knowledge and property management, and 3) the role of small- and medium sized companies. These results bear important implications for innovation practices in the space sector. ",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.02,0.0,-0.01,0.02,0.01,0.005

Open Innovation strategies such as external technology acquisition (ETA), and external technology exploitation (ETE), can effectively improve the innovation performance of the organizations. Technologies like social media can help organizations to scout for appropriate technology, and source for ideas and knowledge from external sources to support their innovations. Moreover, digitalization can hasten business operations and enhance the innovation process of the firm. Focusing on Open Innovation, this study takes an integrated approach towards investigating the impact of OI strategies, technology scouting through social media, and digitalization vision on innovation and firm performance. Data were drawn from 153 organizations in Malaysia, and the partial least squares (PLS) method was used to analyze data. The findings revealed that ETE, technology scouting through social media, and digitalization vision have a significant relationship with innovation performance. This, in turn, shows a positive relationship with firm performance. However, ETA does not have a significant relationship with innovation performance in the Malaysia context. This study extends the current literature on OI through the use of specific technology variables, such as technology scouting through social media and digitalization vision to support organizations' innovation.

659,"Today the world economy is handling an economic crisis caused by the pandemic of a new coronavirus infection (COVID-19), announced by the WHO, as well as by fluctuations in the international energy market and by the development of ""green energy"". The crisis, named the ""2020 crisis"", is notable for the divergence of the sectoral dynamics of development, with a declining development trend in some industries and the rapid growth of others. The crisis is etymologically relevant to the energy sector, a sector which is important for the survival and specialization of the Russian Federation. This research is aimed at describing the status and highlighting the socioeconomic effects, constraints (economic and social risks), and ""growth points"" of the energy sector in the modern realities of the 2020 crisis. Methods. The method of in-depth interview was used. The need for studying expert opinion is based on the fundamental principles of implementation research, according to which the success of state sectoral policy depends on its perception and support by stakeholders. Top managers of energy enterprises acted as the experts (N = 10). The interviews were conducted in April 2020. The method of incremental approximation and coding (open and axial) were used for a high-quality discourse analysis. Results. The conducted study revealed divergence of sectoral dynamics of energy consumption, which is a translation of the immanent features of the 2020 crisis into the energy sector. The detected constraints are reserved development prerequisites of ""green energy"" and reduced investments in development programs. The potential ""growth points"" include intensified digitalization of the energy sector and the need for institutional changes in taxation in the energy sector, recognized by experts.

In this paper, we highlight what we consider to be the problematic use of TCE in the context of Open Innovation, suggesting that it has a limited descriptive power and potentially does normative damage to Open Innovation practice. A case study of the Volvo Group will be drawn upon to illustrate these claims. The case questions the belief that hierarchical control eliminates transaction costs. Also, it suggests that an overemphasis on calculative reduction of transaction costs together with a focus on governance and rationality leave little space for an innovative climate, thus diverting attention away from the creative potential of transactions. Indeed the self-fulfilling prophecy character of subscribing to the assumptions of TCE may not merely limit but actually undermine innovation.

However, vehicles remain largely as black boxes to researchers and application developers, and open source platforms for evaluating networked VSC solutions at high-fidelity and scale are still lacking. To exploit the potential of networked VSC, we develop the research infrastructure VInsight, which provides basic building blocks for gaining insight into vehicle internals and for enabling high-fidelity, at-scale evaluation of networked VSC solutions. More specifically, VInsight integrates the OpenXC vehicular sensing platform into the Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI). VInsight deploys a WiMAX research network for integrating high-fidelity real-world vehicular sensing with at-scale ns-3 emulation in the GENI cloud computing facilities, and VInsight develops WiMAX measurement tools for understanding WiMAX link characteristics and driving high-fidelity emulation of networked VSC systems.1 The WiMAX network of VInsight also enables immediate applications such as campus safety patrol; this synergy with opt-in users enables the permanent deployment of VInsight for Open Innovation in networked VSC systems, thus helping develop solutions to address the grand challenges of road transportation today.

666,"Using a longitudinal in-depth field study at NASA, I investigate how the open, or peer-production, innovation model affects R&D professionals, their work, and the locus of innovation. R&D professionals are known for keeping their knowledge work within clearly defined boundaries, protecting it from individuals outside those boundaries, and rejecting meritorious innovation that is created outside disciplinary boundaries. The Open Innovation model challenges these boundaries and opens the knowledge work to be conducted by anyone who chooses to contribute. At NASA, the open model led to a scientific breakthrough at unprecedented speed using unusually limited resources; yet it challenged not only the knowledge-work boundaries but also the professional identity of the R&D professionals. This led to divergent reactions from R&D professionals, as adopting the open model required them to go through a multifaceted transformation. Only R&D professionals who underwent identity refocusing work dismantled their boundaries, truly adopting the knowledge from outside and sharing their internal knowledge. Others who did not go through that identity work failed to incorporate the solutions the open model produced. Adopting Open Innovation without a change in R&D professionals’ identity resulted in no real change in the R&D process. This paper reveals how such processes unfold and illustrates the critical role of professional identity work in changing knowledge-work boundaries and shifting the locus of innovation.

669,"Various scholars have accomplished a great deal to better understand Open Innovation effectiveness. Case studies have detailed its performance effects, while other studies showed the effectiveness of an aspect of Open Innovation, such as collaboration with third parties, external technology commercialization, and cocreation. Though most studies report a positive relation between Open Innovation and innovation performance, some studies indicate possible negative effects. This has resulted in a call for research on what kind of organizational context suits Open Innovation best. This study therefore addresses two questions: (1) does performing Open Innovation activities lead to increased innovation performance, and to which aspects of innovation performance is Open Innovation most strongly related? (2) what is the moderating impact of various kinds of strategic orientation on the relation between Open Innovation and innovation performance? In this study, we investigate three types of strategic orientations: entrepreneurial orientation, market orientation, and resource orientation. In a survey among 223 Asian service firms, we first develop and test a comprehensive measurement scale for Open Innovation that captures the entire range of Open Innovation activities, including outside-in activities, inside-out activities, and coupled activities. The final scale comprises of 10 items and indicates to what extent a firm has implemented Open Innovation activities. Next, we study the relation between Open Innovation and innovation performance. The results indicate that performing Open Innovation activities is significantly and positively related to all four dimensions of innovation performance: new product/service innovativeness, new product/service success, customer performance, and financial performance. The impact of Open Innovation is not limited to a particular aspect of innovation performance; it positively affects a broad range of innovation performance indicators. Though Open Innovation is positively related to all four dimensions of innovation performance, the effect sizes are not equal. The impact on new service innovativeness and financial performance is relatively stronger. Regarding the influence of a firm's strategic orientation, we find that all significant moderation effects are positive. This suggests that, in general, having a more explicit strategic orientation enhances the effectiveness of Open Innovation. When comparing the three strategic orientations, entrepreneurial orientation strengthens the positive performance effects of Open Innovation significantly more than market orientation and resource orientation do. In turn, market orientation has a significantly stronger moderation effect than resource orientation. These findings provide empirical evidence of the context dependency of Open Innovation. Especially an entrepreneurial orientation, which is associated with proactive and entrepreneurial processes, seems to create a fertile setting for Open Innovation.

However, the use of customer knowledge also has an important downside as customers may often be conservative (for many good reasons), forcing producer firms to search for new solutions along established paths, while shying away from truly new and promising opportunities. In this paper these two forces are reconciled through an argument stating that there is an inverse U-shaped relationship between the intensity of the use of customer knowledge and innovative performance. We hypothesize that the negative effect at high levels of intensity of the use of customer knowledge is offset by firms' broader search strategies in terms of the breadth of external search among other sources of innovation: If firms search more broadly among several sources of innovation, they are much more likely to enjoy the benefits of customer knowledge, while avoiding important negative aspects.

This effect is more pronounced when perceived opportunism is higher (i.e., firms in high-tech industries, or in countries with less disclosure transparency), and when formal contracts are less enforceable (i.e., in countries with relatively weak legal systems). We further show that Open Innovation is the channel through which societal trust promotes innovative efficiency. Overall, our study establishes societal trust as a key factor in influencing the efficiency of Open Innovation. ",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.028,0.031,-0.008,0.0,0.012,-0.025
688,"While recent studies shed some light on the performance implications of Open Innovation, there is a gap in understanding how firms can translate their openness into innovation outcomes. In particular, it is unclear whether—and if so, how—firms can create a competitive advantage in product innovation by tapping into external sources of innovation. To address this gap, this study conceptualizes multidimensional components of absorptive capacity and develops a nomological network that explicates relationships between these components and competitive advantage in product innovation. By marrying the Open Innovation and absorptive capacity perspectives, higher-order models of absorptive capacity are proposed which delineate the underlying processes to recognize, assimilate, and exploit external sources of innovation. The empirical analysis of the nomological network based on original survey data reveals important findings. First, there is a positive indirect baseline association between external technological resource access and competitive advantage in product innovation, mediated by the firm's technology-related capabilities. Second, components of absorptive capacity modify this indirect baseline relationship. Recognition capacity is positively associated with external technological resource access and therefore, operates as an antecedent to the proposed baseline relationship. Assimilation capacity constitutes a relevant condition to the proposed baseline relationship. The indirect association between external technological resource access and competitive advantage in product innovation is dependent on the level of assimilation capacity. Exploitation capacity has an additional and independent direct positive association with competitive advantage in product innovation. This study contributes to the Open Innovation literature by delineating organizational processes that help to explain interfirm differences in benefiting from external sources of innovation. In addition, this study adds to the absorptive capacity literature by developing and validating a set of measures that captures, individually and in concert, three components of absorptive capacity.

689,"While the research on Open Innovation is flourishing, less attention has so far been given to ‘outbound’ processes in comparison to ‘inbound’ and ‘coupled’ Open Innovation. In this paper we analyze a qualitative case study of the global bio-pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca and their attempt to establish a spinout initiative where internal projects are transferred to entrepreneurial startups funded by external venture capital. We explain the enactment work of this initiative and identify three emerged managerial challenges, linked to (1) internal decision-making, (2) the cultural and psychological barriers of what we phrase as the ‘not-invented-elsewhere’ (NIE) syndrome, and (3) the ability to translate and communicate internal projects as attractive external proposals. Theoretical and managerial implications in relation to these challenges are outlined and discussed. ",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.016,-0.012,-0.018,-0.007,-0.004,-0.002
690,"Wine Influencers (WIs) represent a new type of independent third party endorsers that are progressively establishing themselves within social networks. This study analyzes the characteristics of the activity of WIs and the communication model used via Instagram. Netnographic Analysis, Factor Analysis and AGIL methods were applied. The results show five Key-findings within specific relationships established during discussions: advice from Wine Influencers and generalized reciprocity in relationships; structural and social bonds established based on the frequency of messages from regular followers; peer-to-peer relationship development through recommendation; development of trust established through online relationships; wine influencer’s influence on followers regarding everything about the wine. The study derives a model that explains the communication dimensions used by WIs that are: advertising (information about product/brand) (35.71%); persuasion—added value to brand and product (42.62%); brand democratization (10.07%); and identity (8.03%). This study provides a novel contribution to the Open Innovation process of small and medium-sized wine industries for their marketing strategies.

691,"With globalisation, there has been an intensification of investments by foreign groups in sectors strategic to their country of origin, such as some minerals. It is, therefore, crucial for a parent company to implement specific controls in its management control systems. In these circumstances, this study aims to determine the degree of control exercised by the parent company over a subsidiary in cultural and organisational dimensions. In addition, other exogenous factors (entities and external factors) influence this system. The results obtained showed that the parent company had an influence on the Management Control System (MCS) of the subsidiary and changed the way control was exercised there, but was unable to deal with macroeconomic instability, environmental and strategic uncertainty, and, consequently, the management risk involved in the extractive activity; in this case, for this subsidiary to operate a seam mine and not be aware of it since it is essentially a commercial, economic group. In addition to these effects on the organisational dimension and the cultural dimension, the shareholders were unable to integrate the subsidiary’s organisational and local culture, which generated some dynamic tension with the expatriate. In addition to the theoretical framework used, it was confirmed that the Flamholtz model is passive to implement in industries in general, particularly in the extractive industry. Finally, some final considerations were made about the management control system, in which the argument is reinforced that there must be empathy between the local staff and the expatriate, as a representative of the shareholders, in order for this system to be a vehicle for the effective transfer of knowledge between both parties, as well as to be supported by Open Innovation.

692,"With increasingly severe environmental regulations, a pressing issue has been the need for firms to develop efficient strategies to achieve environmental protection and high productivity. Several environmental experts argue that firms can respond to environmental regulations through innovation; however, the question of how to innovate is unanswered in the environmental literature. Therefore, this study focuses on the Open Innovation strategy approach to respond to environmental regulations and maintain high productivity by incorporating the idea of innovation management. We first divide Open Innovation strategy into two modes of external technology acquisition: foreign and domestic. Next, we examine these modes' mediation effects on environmental regulations and productivity. In addition, we test the moderating effect of internal R&D on the relationship between external technology acquisition and productivity. Using data on 35 Chinese industrial sectors from 2001 to 2010, the empirical findings show that foreign technology significantly and positively mediates the link between environmental regulations and productivity, while domestic technology does not. Internal R&D investment, as an absorptive capacity, positively moderates the effect of foreign technology; however, it negatively moderates the effect of domestic technology on productivity.

693,"With its focus on value creation and value capture, Open Innovation research explicitly or implicitly examines the competitive impacts of collaboration. However, to date such research has not considered the effects of a blockbuster industry structure upon Open Innovation. Here, we examine a particular form of multilateral collaboration, the open R&D consortium, in which the results from collaboration are allowed to spill over to members and nonmembers alike. We do so in the context of the pharmaceutical industry, a stable but fragmented industry defined by the ongoing search for blockbuster hits protected by strong appropriability. Using a novel data set, we identify 141 such consortia that involve two or more of the 30 largest pharma firms. We show that firms financially support such consortia, in part, because their value creation activities benefit members without disrupting the value capture or other aspects of the incumbent industry structure. We discuss the implications of these findings for research on multilateral collaboration in blockbuster industries, and Open Innovation more generally.",Social Sciences & Humanities,0.028,0.006,-0.017,-0.023,0.027,-0.016
