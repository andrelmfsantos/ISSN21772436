But not all innovation projects lead to commercialisation; some are abandoned, and these abandoned innovation projects can be classified as a waste of resources. Therefore, this paper studies the influence of different external sources and a firm’s decision to abandon an innovation project. The purpose of this paper is to provide a broader understanding of abandoned projects. Design/methodology/approach: The data applied are quantitative data and the empirical background is the Danish Innovation Survey 2009. The sample consists of Danish manufacturing firms with ten employees or more (n=840). The results are based on logistic regression analysis. Findings: Results reveal that firms should consider that the involvement of customers can lead them to abandon innovation projects. However, if firms combine customers with universities, it will decrease the likelihood of innovation projects being abandoned. A more in-depth analysis shows that the involvement of customers from “Europe” (countries in Europe excluding Denmark) and the “US” leads to innovation projects being abandoned while customers from “other countries” (the rest of the world, including China and India) have the opposite effect. Originality/value: The contribution is to the limited literature on abandoned innovation projects by suggesting that the type of external sources is a significant factor in firms’ decisions to abandon innovation projects. The paper identifies that the involvement of certain external sources leads firms to decide to abandon innovation projects, and that the country of origin of the external sources is an important criterion to consider in relation to a firm’s decision to abandon innovation projects.

To do so, this paper empirically tests the impact of organizational culture, employees’ knowledge, attitudes and rewards as antecedents and mediators of OI adoption in organizations, facilitating a more thorough understanding by using an empirical multi-level approach. Design/methodology/approach: This paper analyzes the results of the “Identification of Industrial Needs for Open Innovation Education in Europe” survey through a quantitative analysis using logistic regression models. This survey includes 528 employees working in 28 different industrial sectors in 37 countries, most of which are in Europe. Findings: The results suggest a positive impact of organizational characteristics on the adoption of OI (i.e. including the adoption of outside-in and inside-out OI activities in participating organizations), showing that the openness of an organization’s culture increases its likelihood of adopting an OI paradigm. More importantly, the results highlight the positive mediating effect of employees’ knowledge and rewards on this relationship. Research limitations/implications: The data set that was the basis of this paper was generated in European countries, the results of the analysis are limited and appropriate for this region and may vary when applied to other regions of the world. Practical implications: The proposed multi-level approach offers new insight into organizational knowledge. It enables the improvement of OI and knowledge management practices in organizations by assisting practitioners and academics in recognizing the relationship between organizational culture; employees’ knowledge, attitudes and rewards; and the adoption of the OI paradigm. Social implications: This paper offers a possible explanation on why open-border cultures are more likely to have a successful OI adoption, by relating it to factors that advance in the presence of an open-border culture, such as active participation of OI relative departments in knowledge sourcing and knowledge exchange, and rewarding employees for OI activities. Originality/value: This paper presents a new framework which links organizational culture to OI, moving on from merely examining culture in terms of its positive or negative impact on OI adoption. It contributes to research on the OI paradigm and knowledge management by highlighting the significance of antecedents and mediators from a multi-level perspective using multiple units of analysis. Most previous studies focus on a single unit of analysis. ",10.1108/JKM-02-2020-0122

Such incentive is often provided in the form of public subsidies to research and development activities. Some studies observed that public subsidies are generally successful in pursuing the goal of promoting Open Innovation. Nevertheless, as the number of partners increases, the positive effect of collaboration on innovation performance is likely to decrease due to over-search and over-collaboration issues. In this perspective, a mere increase of the firms' propensity to collaborate should not satisfy public authorities, which instead should carefully monitor how public subsidies can improve the efficiency of such collaborations. This article advances the literature about the relationship between public subsidies and Open Innovation by assessing how funds provided by local, national and European authorities are associated with Open Innovation efficiency. By analysing an extensive sample of 43,230 European firms, this study confirms that the three typologies of public subsidies are associated with collaboration in beneficiaries. Furthermore, the study shows that local and national subsidies are also associated with Open Innovation efficiency, whereas European subsidies are not statistically significantly associated with it. This study provides theoretical and policy implications. In a theoretical perspective, it introduces the concept of Open Innovation efficiency, it analyses its public policy drivers and presents several recommendations for future research. In a policy perspective, it suggests explanations for the results obtained and advises policy initiatives to foster Open Innovation efficiency. ",10.1016/j.techfore.2017.02.022

All this requires a new Open Innovation approach, which means that stakeholders from regional administrations, hospitals, companies and intermediate organisations openly work together towards commonly identified global and regional digital health goals. Although both practice and theory have proven that the Open Innovation approach is beneficial for companies and end-users, there is still a need for increased understanding of what leads to the success of digital health related to regional competitiveness through the implementation of policies based on people-centred Open Innovation. This study is a longitudinal case study in which Open Innovation ecosystem partners (including challengers (healthcare organisation representatives), solvers (companies), funders (policy organisations) and supporters (intermediate organisations) were monitored and analysed in three countries. The focus of the paper is to explore a digital health Open Innovation ecosystem over the years. The results show that the created demand-driven Open Innovation model can be used to strengthen the governance of digital health, and to improve communication density and knowledge transfer between the ecosystem actors. The new model is a useful way to make funding structures clearer and to improve the people centricity of digital health solutions. The findings help policy-makers to use Open Innovation as a policy instrument supporting hospital and company managers to increase understanding of the opportunities of demand-driven Open Innovation.

5,163,5,99.77,"knowledge, firm, external, study, source, search, research, absorptive_capacity, ha, finding, practice, management, performance, product, level, process, information, openness, organizational, intermediary","Integrating insights from the strategic goal literature and the knowledge-based view of the firm, this article proposes that the pursuit of social and economic strategic goals by commercial firms affects their innovation performance through different knowledge sourcing activities. The strategic goals, knowledge sourcing practices, and innovation performance of 1257 Belgian firms are investigated. Results show that both social and economic strategic goals are associated with the use of external information sources, but only the pursuit of social goals inspires firms to engage in external collaboration. No evidence is found of an inherent conflict between social and economic strategic goals. Instead, the two types of goals are independent of each other, that is, an emphasis on social goals does not preclude an emphasis on economic goals and vice versa. Moreover, firms’ external knowledge sourcing and innovation performance benefit most when strongly held social goals align with strongly held economic goals. These findings offer new insight into the nature and the effects of goal multiplicity among commercial firms. They open up a new perspective on the potential positive effects of the joint pursuit of social and economic strategic goals instead of seeing them as inherently conflicting, as past research has typically done. We illustrate how social strategic goals can deliver unique benefits to a firm, independently of and in addition to economic strategic goals. Our findings also contribute to the Open Innovation literature by revealing strategic goals as a driver of firms’ knowledge sourcing practices. Our findings suggest that solely emphasizing economic goals may be one reason why firms struggle to implement Open Innovation practices and do not reap their full benefits. The practical implications of our research are discussed. ",10.1111/jpim.12511

However, their contribution to health innovation is poorly recognized and often invisible. The aim of this study was to determine the profile of innovative ideas recorded by nurses in the Innòbics ideas bank, a corporate virtual community of Open Innovation. Design and Methods: We used a cross-sectional study design. We identified all the innovative ideas recorded in Innòbics from June 8, 2016, to July 6, 2018. To be eligible, the ideas had to be recorded by nurses. Each innovative idea recorded was assessed by the Certification Evaluation Committee of Innòbics. After collective discussion during the evaluation sessions, each committee member independently scored the idea. The screening decision was based on the overall average score. The following variables were collected from each innovative idea that was recorded: (a) level of health care where the idea originated (primary care or secondary care), (b) subject or category according to the classification of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Health Care Innovations Exchange, (c) ratings relative to each screening criteria, and (d) the result of the screening decision: stored = ideas that were poorly developed and in which it was not possible to identify their potential for innovation; susceptible of improvement = potential ideas that needed to be improved and whose authors received comments from the evaluation committee; validated = ideas that continued the process to become innovation projects; forwarded = ideas that were not innovative but they were a complaint or a proposal for quality improvement (these were forwarded to the institutional department concerned). Findings: A total of 246 innovative ideas were recorded in the period of the study, 61 (24.8%) of which were recorded by nurses. The subjects and categories of these ideas were diverse, highlighting aspects such as patient-centered care, quality improvement strategies, preventive and chronic care, and primary care. Thirty-five (57.4%) of these innovative ideas were stored, 13 (21.3%) were susceptible to improvement, 11 (18.0%) were forwarded, and 2 (3.3%) were validated. Conclusions: The results demonstrated that approximately a quarter of the ideas were recorded by nurses. Subjects and categories of these ideas were diverse, some of them closely related to the profession and nursing practice. Two ideas were identified as potential innovation projects. Innòbics can act as an organizational tool that promotes a climate for innovation in health care. Clinical Relevance: This study recognizes nurses’ contribution to a healthcare innovation initiative and their interest in sharing innovative ideas. Its findings provide useful insights into a virtual community of Open Innovation such as an organizational tool for encouraging creativity and innovation in healthcare. Likewise, there is also a need for further development of nurses to master healthcare innovation as a basic competence. ",10.1111/jnu.12559
